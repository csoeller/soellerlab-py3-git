	abstract = {Eukaryotic cell division requires the mitotic spindle, a microtubule (MT)-based structure which accurately aligns and segregates duplicated chromosomes. The dynamics of spindle formation are determined primarily by correctly localising the MT nucleator, γ-Tubulin Ring Complex (γ-TuRC), within the cell. A conserved MT-associated protein complex, Augmin, recruits γ-TuRC to pre-existing spindle MTs, amplifying their number, in an essential cellular phenomenon termed ‘branching’ MT nucleation. Here, we purify endogenous, GFP-tagged Augmin and γ-TuRC from Drosophila embryos to near homogeneity using a novel one-step affinity technique. We demonstrate that, in vitro, while Augmin alone does not affect Tubulin polymerisation dynamics, it stimulates γ-TuRC-dependent MT nucleation in a cell cycle-dependent manner. We also assemble and visualise the MT-Augmin-γ-TuRC-MT junction using light microscopy. Our work therefore conclusively reconstitutes branching MT nucleation. It also provides a powerful synthetic approach with which to investigate the emergence of cellular phenomena, such as mitotic spindle formation, from component parts.},

	abstract = {Heart failure (HF) is defined by compromised contractile function and is associated with changes in excitation-contraction (EC) coupling and cardiomyocyte organisation. Tissue level changes often include fibrosis, while changes within cardiomyocytes often affect structures critical to EC coupling, including the ryanodine receptor (RyR), the associated protein junctophilin-2 (JPH2) and the transverse tubular system architecture. Using a novel approach, we aimed to directly correlate the influence of structural alterations with force development in ventricular trabeculae from failing human hearts. Trabeculae were excised from explanted human hearts in end-stage failure and immediately subjected to force measurements. Following functional experiments, each trabecula was fixed, sectioned and immuno-stained for structural investigations. Peak stress was highly variable between trabeculae from both within and between failing hearts and was strongly correlated with the cross-sectional area occupied by myocytes (MCSA), rather than total trabecula cross-sectional area. At the cellular level, myocytes exhibited extensive microtubule densification which was linked via JPH2 to time-to-peak stress. Trabeculae fractional MCSA variability was much higher than that in adjacent free wall samples. Together, these findings identify several structural parameters implicated in functional impairment in human HF and highlight the structural variability of ventricular trabeculae which should be considered when interpreting functional data.},

	abstract = {Microscopic calcium (Ca2+) events (such as Ca2+ sparks) are an important area for study, as they help clarify the mechanism(s) underlying intracellular signaling. In the heart, Ca2+ sparks occur as a result of Ca2+ release from the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum, via ryanodine receptor channels. Measurement of Ca2+ spark properties can provide valuable information about the control of ryanodine receptor channel gating in situ, but requires high spatiotemporal resolution imaging, which produces noisy datasets that are problematic for spark detection. Automated detection algorithms may overcome visual detection bias, but missed and false-positive events can distort the distribution of measured Ca2+ spark properties. We present a sensitive and reliable method for the automated detection of Ca2+ sparks in datasets obtained using confocal line-scanning or total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. This matched-filter detection algorithm(MFDA) employs a user-defined object, chosen to mimic Ca2+ spark properties, and the experimental dataset is searched for instances of the object. Detection certainty is provided by nonparametric statistical testing. The supplied codes can also refine the search object on the basis of those detected to further increase detection sensitivity. In comparison to a commonly used, intensity-thresholding algorithm, the MFDA is more sensitive and reliable, particularly at low signal/noise ratios. The MFDA can also be easily adapted to other signal-detection problems in noisy datasets.},

	abstract = {A major motivation for the use of super-resolution imaging methods in the investigation of cardiac biophysics has been the insight from biophysical considerations and detailed mathematical modeling that the spatial structure and protein organisation at the scale of nanometres can have enormous implications for calcium signalling in cardiac muscle. We illustrate the use of dSTORM based super-resolution in optically thick (∼10 μm) tissue slices of rat ventricular tissue to visualize proteins at the cardiac Z-disk and compare those images with confocal (diffraction-limited) as well as electron microscopy (EM) data which still provides a benchmark in terms of resolution. α-actinin is an abundant protein target that effectively defines the Z-disk in striated muscle and provides a reference structure for other proteins at the Z-line and the transverse tubules. Using super-resolution imaging α-actinin labelling provides very detailed outlines of the contractile machinery which we have used to study the properties of Z-disks and the distribution of α-actinin itself. We determined the local diameters of the myo-fibrillar and non-myofibrillar space using α-actinin labelling. Comparison between confocal and super-resolution based myofibrillar masks suggested that super-resolution data was able to segment myofibrils accurately while confocal approaches were not always able to distinguish neighbouring myofibrillar bundles which resulted in overestimated diameters. The increased resolution of super-resolution methods provides qualitatively new information to improve our understanding of cardiac biophysics. Nevertheless, conventional diffraction-limited imaging still has an important role to play which we illustrate with correlative confocal and super-resolution data.},

	abstract = {Computer simulations were used to examine the response of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) to the sarcolemmal calcium influx via L-type calcium channels (DHPRs). The effects of ryanodine receptor organization, diad geometry, DHPR single-channel current, and DHPR gating were examined. In agreement with experimental findings, the simulations showed that RyRs can respond rapidly (approximately 0.4 ms) to calcium influx via DHPRs. The responsiveness of the RyR depends on the geometrical arrangement between the RyRs and the DHPR in the diad, with wider diads being generally less responsive. When the DHPR single-channel current is small (approximately 25 fA), the organization of RyRs into small clusters results in an improved responsiveness. With experimentally observed DHPR mean open and closed times (0.17 ms and 4 ms, respectively) it is the first opening of the DHPR that is most likely to activate the RyR. A measure of the efficiency (Q) by which DHPR gating evokes sarcoplasmic reticulum release is defined. Q is at maximum for tau approximately 0.3 ms, and we interpret this finding in terms of the "tuning" of DHPR gating to RyR response. If certain cardiac myopathies are associated with a mismatch in the "tuning," then modification of DHPR gating with drugs to "retune" calcium-induced calcium release should be possible.},

The effect of various cytosolic and membranebound buffers, diad geometry, DHPR properties (open time and current), and surface charge were examined. The simulations showed that phospholipid binding sites on the sarcolemmal membrane are the major buffer affecting free calcium ([Ca2+]) levels in the diad. The inclusion of surface charge effects calculated from Gouy-Chapman theory resulted in a marked decrease in [Ca2+] levels at all times and a faster decay of [Ca2+] after termination of DHPR influx. For a DHPR current of 200 fA, [Ca2+] at the center of the diad reached peak levels of approximately 73 microM. In larger diads ({\textgreater} or = 400 nm diameter), [Ca2+] decayed more slowly than in smaller diads (100-200 nm diameter), although peak [Ca2+] levels reached during typical DHPR open times were similar. For a wide range of DHPR single-channel current magnitudes (Ica = 25-200 fA), [Ca2+] levels in the diad were approximately proportional to ICa. The decrease in calculated [Ca2+] levels due to the effects of surface charge can be interpreted as resulting from an effective "volume expansion" of the diad space. Furthermore, the layer of increased [Ca2+] close to the sarcolemmal membrane can act as a fast buffer.},

	abstract = {The availability of rapid and specific biosensors is of great importance for many areas of biomedical  research and modern biotechnology. This includes a need for DNA sensors where the progress of molecular biology demands routine detection of minute concentrations of specific gene fragments. A promising alternative approach to traditional DNA essays utilizes novel smart materials, including conducting polymers and nanostructured materials such as quantum dots. We have constructed a number of DNA 
sensors based on smart materials that allow rapid one-step detection of unlabeled DNA fragments with high specificity. These sensors are based on functionalized conducting polymers derived from polypyrrole (PPy) and poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (PPV). PPy based sensors provide intrinsic electrical readout via cyclic
voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The performance of these sensors is compared to a novel self-assembled monolayer-PNA construct on a gold electrode. Characterization of the novel PNA based sensor shows that it has comparable performance to the PPy based sensors and can also be read out effectively using AC cyclic voltammetry. Complementary to such solid substrate sensors we have developed a novel optical DNA essay based on a new PPV derived cationic conducting polymer. DNA detection in this essay results from sample dependent fluorescence resonance energy transfer changes
between the cationic conducting polymer and Cy3 labeled probe oligonucleotides. As an alternative to such fluorochrome based sensors we discuss the use of inorganic nanocrystals (‘quantum dots’) and present data from water soluble CdTe quantum dots synthesized in an aqueous environment.},

	volume = {125},
	url = {http://dev.biologists.org/content/125/23/4627.short},
	abstract = {Mouse sperm-egg fusion was examined using two-photon and confocal microscopy. A delay of several minutes occurred between the first observable event of fusion (which was the diffusion of Ca2+-sensitive dyes from egg into sperm) and any change in egg cytoplasmic Ca2+. When indo-1 dextran was used to obtain ratiometric two-photon images, there was no detectable local increase in egg cytoplasmic Ca2+ near the site of sperm fusion. However, the sperm underwent a Ca2+ transient which appeared to be coincident with the egg cytoplasm Ca2+ transient, which suggested that there was a high permeability pathway for Ca2+ between egg and sperm. To exclude this pathway from providing trigger Ca2+ for the egg transient, we reduced bathing [Ca2+] to approx. 18 microM and 13nM (with EGTA). In these conditions the first egg Ca2+ transient was not prevented, which makes an obligatory role for extracellular Ca2+ in the initiation of the egg Ca2+ transient unlikely. Both FITC-albumin (70 kDa) and 10 kDa dextran-linked Ca2+ indicators were able to diffuse into the sperm from the egg. In addition, phycoerythrin (240 kDa) rapidly diffused into the sperm shortly after fusion (but before any changes in Ca2+ occurred). This suggests that the 'pore(s)' that form during sperm-egg fusion must be at least 8 nm in diameter. These data are compatible with the idea that a diffusible sperm protein could trigger the observed changes in intracellular Ca2+ in the egg, but do not exclude the possibility that other second messengers are generated during sperm-egg fusion.},

	abstract = {Two-photon molecular excitation microscopy has several advantages over conventional confocal fluorescence microscopy, including the ability to section deeper into scattering samples and to allow spatially resolved flash photolysis. We describe and examine the benefit of incorporating non-descanned fluorescence detection in our microscope system. In a scattering sample where almost no signal could be obtained at a depth of 50 microm with confocal detection, non-descanned detection resulted in an improvement of signal strength by more than an order of magnitude at depths {\textgreater}40 microm. The spatio-temporal properties of stationary spot two-photon excited flash photolysis (TPEFP) in drops of test solutions and cardiac myocytes were also examined. At input powers that produce {\textgreater}10\% of the maximum rate of DM-nitrophen photolysis, serious photodestruction of the reporter fluorochrome (Fluo-3) at the photolysis spot occurred. At power levels of approximately 4 mW for periods {\textless}50 ms, we were able to produce small repeatable calcium release events using DM-nitrophen in cardiac myocytes, which were similar to naturally occurring calcium sparks. The properties of these artificial calcium sparks were very similar to signals obtained from drops of test solutions, suggesting that the apparent rate of calcium diffusion in myocytes is similar to the rate of diffusion of Fluo-3 in solution. Using TPEFP, we also examined the ability of a combination of EGTA and a low-affinity calcium indicator to track the time course of calcium release. Although the addition of EGTA improved the temporal fidelity of the rise of the calcium signal, it did not significantly reduce the spread of the fluorescence signal from the photolysis spot.},

	abstract = {Ca2+ signalling is central to cochlear sensory hair cell physiology through its influence on sound transduction, membrane filter properties and neurotransmission. However, the mechanism for establishing Ca2+ homeostasis in these cells remains unresolved. Canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) Ca2+ entry channels provide an important pathway for maintaining intracellular Ca2+ levels. TRPC3 subunit expression was detected in guinea pig and rat organ of Corti by RT-PCR, and localized to the sensory and neural poles of the inner and outer hair cells (OHCs) by confocal immunofluorescence imaging. A cation entry current with a TRPC-like phenotype was identified in guinea pig and rat OHCs by whole-cell voltage clamp. This slowly activating current was induced by the lowering of cytosolic Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]i) following a period in nominally Ca2+-free solution. Activation was dependent upon the [Ca2+]o and was sustained until [Ca(2+)]i was restored. Ca2+ entry was confirmed by confocal fluorescence imaging, and rapidly recruited secondary charybdotoxin- and apamin-sensitive K(Ca) currents. Dual activation by the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-phospholipase C-diacylglycerol (DAG) second messenger pathway was confirmed using the analogue 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG). Ion substitution experiments showed that the putative TRPC Ca2+ entry current was selective for Na+ {\textgreater} K+ with a ratio of 1: 0.6. The Ca2+ entry current was inhibited by the TRPC channel blocker 2-aminoethyl diphenylborate (2APB) and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, erbstatin analogue. We conclude that TRPC Ca2+ entry channels, most likely incorporating TRPC3 subunits, support cochlear hair cell Ca2+ homeostasis and GPCR signalling.},

	abstract = {There have been only a few studies of how allergens cross the airway epithelium to cause allergic sensitization. House dust mite fecal pellets (HDMFP) contain several proteolytic enzymes. Group 1 allergens are cysteine peptidases, whilst those of groups 3, 6 and 9 have catalytic sites indicative of enzymes that mechanistically behave as serine peptidases. We have previously shown that the group 1 allergen Der p 1 leads to cleavage of tight junctions (TJs), allowing allergen delivery to antigen presenting cells. In this study we determined whether HDMFP serine peptidases similarly compromise the airway epithelium by attacking TJs, desmosomes and adherens junctions. Experiments were performed in monolayers of MDCK, Calu-3 or 16HBE14o-epithelial cells. Cell junction morphology was examined by 2-photon molecular excitation microscopy and digital image analysis. Barrier function was measured as mannitol permeability. Cleavage of cell adhesion proteins was studied by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry. HDMFP serine peptidases led to a progressive cleavage of TJs and increased epithelial permeability. Desmosomal puncta became more concentrated. Cleavage of TJs involved proteolysis of the TJ proteins, occludin and ZO-1. This was associated with activation of intracellular proteolysis of ZO-1. In contrast to occludin, E-cadherin of adherens junctions was cleaved less extensively. Although Calu-3 and 16HBE14o-cells expressed tethered ligand receptors for serine peptidases, these were not responsible for transducing the changes in TJs. HDMFP serine peptidases cause cleavage of TJs. This study identifies a second general class of HDM peptidase capable of increasing epithelial permeability and thereby creating conditions that would favour transepithelial delivery of allergens.},

Inside a fiber cell, the diffusion coefficient for fluorescein was 4 x 10(-7) cm(2)/s at 21 degrees C, a value an order of magnitude lower than observed in free solution. Fluorescence also diffused between fiber cells via gap junctions. In the periphery, diffusion between cells occurred mainly in a radial direction while deep in the lens the diffusion between cells appeared more isotropic. Diffusion between cells was slower than inside cells and corresponded to less than approximately 1\% of the area between cells being available for diffusion. This value is in good agreement with that expected from measurements of gap junction structure and packing density if a 1-1.5-nm aqueous gap junction pore is nearly always open.},

A novel NTPDase2beta isoform produced by alternative splicing of the rat NTPDase2 gene provides an extended intracellular C-terminus and distinguishes itself from NTPDase2alpha isoform in gaining several intracellular protein kinase CK2 (casein kinase 2) phosphorylation sites and losing the intracellular protein kinase C motif. The plasmids containing NTPDase2alpha or NTPDase2beta cDNA were used to stably transfect Chinese-hamster ovary-S cells. Imaging studies showed that NTPDase2alpha was predominantly membrane-bound, whereas NTPDase2beta had combined cell surface and intracellular localization. alpha and beta isoforms showed variations in divalent cation dependence and substrate specificity for nucleoside-5'-triphosphates and nucleoside-5'-diphosphates. NTPDase2beta exhibited reduced ATPase activity and no apparent ADPase activity. NTPDase2 isoforms demonstrated similar sensitivity to inhibitors such as suramin and pyridoxal phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid, and differential regulation by protein kinases. NTPDase2beta was up-regulated by intracellular protein kinase CK2 phosphorylation, whereas NTPDase2alpha activity was down-regulated by protein kinase C phosphorylation. The results demonstrate that alternative coding of the intracellular C-terminal domain contributes distinctive phenotypic variation with respect to extracellular nucleotide specificity, hydrolysis kinetics, protein kinase-dependent intracellular regulation and protein trafficking. These findings advance the molecular physiology of this enzyme system by characterizing the contribution of the C-terminal domain to many of the enzyme's signature properties.},

We have developed an experimental imaging approach that allows the distribution of lens membrane proteins to be mapped with subcellular resolution over large distances as a function of fibre cell differentiation. 2. Using this approach in the rat lens, we have localized precisely histological sites of connexin 46 cleavage, quantitatively mapped changes in gap junction distribution and fibre cell morphology and correlated these changes to differences in intercellular dye transfer. 3. Profiling of glucose transporter isoform expression showed that lens epithelial cells express GLUT1, whereas deeper cortical fibre cells express the higher-affinity GLUT3 isoform. Near the lens periphery, GLUT3 was located in the cytoplasm of fibre cells, but it underwent a differentiation-dependent membrane insertion. 4. Similarly, the putative adhesion protein membrane protein 20 is inserted into fibre cell membranes at the stage when the cells lose their nuclei. This redistribution is strikingly rapid in terms of fibre cell differentiation and correlates with a barrier to extracellular diffusion. 5. Our imaging-orientated approach has facilitated new insights into the relationships between fibre cell differentiation and lens function. Taken together, our results indicate that a number of strategies are used by the lens during the course of normal differentiation to change the subcellular distribution, gross spatial location and functional properties of key membrane transport proteins.},

NTPDase2 has broad substrate specificity for extracellular nucleotides, but hydrolyses nucleoside 5'-triphosphates with high preference over nucleoside 5'-diphosphates. In this study, we have sought to determine how enzyme substrates acting on P2 receptors affect intracellular NTPDase2 trafficking. To achieve this, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transiently transfected with rat-specific NTPDase2 cDNA tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP), to allow direct visualisation of subcellular localisation and trafficking of NTPDase2. Cells were superfused with NTPDase2 substrates (ATP and UTP) and synthetic nucleotide analogues (ATPgammaS and ADPbetaS), and confocal image stacks were acquired at regular time intervals. NTPDase2 incorporation into the plasma membrane was determined by comparative analysis of fluorescence intensity in the cytosolic and membrane compartments. GFP-tagged NTPDase2 was fully functional and ATP and ATPgammaS induced membrane incorporation of GFP-NTPDase2 from putative intracellular stores, whilst UTP and ADPbetaS were ineffective. The increased ATP hydrolysis rate correlated with increased NTPDase2 trafficking to the plasma membrane. ATP-induced NTPDase2 trafficking was mediated by activation of endogenous P2X receptors involving Ca2+ entry rather than by P2Y receptor-induced release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Our results suggest that P2X receptor activation stimulates insertion of latent NTPDase2 into the plasma membrane. The increase in surface-located NTPDase2 may reflect a regulatory mechanism counteracting excessive stimulation and desensitisation of P2 receptors.},

	abstract = {Single rat ventricular myocytes and human ventricle tissue sections were labeled with antibodies against the ryanodine receptor (RyR) and alpha-actinin to examine the 3D distribution of RyRs with confocal microscopy. Image contrast was maximized by refractive index matching and deconvolution. The RyR label formed discrete puncta representing clusters of RyRs or "couplons" around the edges of the myofilaments with a nearest-neighbor spacing of 0.66 +/- 0.06 microm in rat and 0.78 +/- 0.07 microm in human. Each bundle of myofibrils was served by approximately six couplons, which supplied a cross-sectional area of approximately 0.6 microm(2) in rat and approximately 0.8 microm(2) in human. Although the couplons were in reasonable registration with z-lines, there were discontinuities in the longitudinal position of sarcomeres so that dislocations in the order of RyR clusters occurred. There was approximately 53\% longitudinal registration of RyR clusters, suggesting a nonrandom placement of couplons around the sarcomere. These data can explain the spherical propagation of Ca(2+) waves and provide quantitative 3D data sets needed for accurate modeling of cardiac Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release. By quantifying labeling intensity in rat ventricular myocytes, a lower limit of 78 RyRs per cluster (on average) was obtained. By modeling the couplon as a disk wrapping around a t-tubule and fitting cluster images, 95\% of couplons contained between 120 and 260 RyRs (assuming that RyRs are tight packed with a spacing of 29 nm). Assuming similar labeling efficiency in human, from the fluorescence intensity alone we estimate that human ventricular myocytes contain approximately 30\% fewer RyRs per couplon than rat.},

The resolution of the three-dimensional structure was improved by a novel transverse sectioning method as well as digital deconvolution. In contrast to earlier reports, the mean RyR2 cluster transverse spacing was measured 1.05 microm in ventricular myocytes and estimated 0.97 microm in atrial myocytes. Intercalated RyR2 clusters were found interspersed between the Z-disks on the cell periphery but absent in the interior, forming double rows flanking the local Z-disks on the surface. The longitudinal spacing between the adjacent rows of RyR2 clusters on the Z-disks was measured to have a mean value of 1.87 microm in ventricular and 1.69 microm in atrial myocytes. The measured RyR2 cluster distribution is compatible with models of Ca2+ wave generation. The size of the typical RyR2 cluster was close to 250 nm, and this suggests that approximately 100 RyR2s might be present in a cluster. The importance of cluster size and three-dimensional spacing for current E-C coupling models is discussed.},

We have exploited excitation-energy-dependent fluorescence edge-shift of recombinant protein labelled with a molecular beacon, to provide a sensitive read out for the presence of sub-visible protein aggregates. To demonstrate the potential utility of the approach we examine the major peptide associated with the initiation of Alzheimer's disease, amyloid β-protein (Aβ) at a patho-physiologically relevant concentration in mouse cortical neurons. Using our approach, we find preliminary evi-dence that sub-visible Aβ aggregates are detected at specific subcellular regions and that neurons drive the formation of specific Aβ aggregate conformations. These findings therefore demonstrate the potential of a novel fluorescence-based approach for detecting and imaging protein aggregates in a cellular context, which can be used to sensitively probe the association of early-stage toxic protein aggregates within subcellular compartments.},

	abstract = {Since its inception, super-resolution microscopy has played an increasingly important role in the discovery and characterization of nanoscale biological structure. dSTORM, which is one of the most commonly applied methods, relies on stochastic photoswitching of fluorophores to recreate a super-resolution image. The cardiac field has particularly benefitted from the application of this technique, as it has enabled sub-diffraction-limit visualization of calcium release units (CRUs) and the fundamental structures that trigger contraction. Acquisition of such images requires careful, reproducible sample preparation, and consistent imaging conditions maintained for the duration of the experiment. Here we present standardized methods for the production of dSTORM images of the Ca2+ release channel Ryanodine Receptor type-2 (RyR2) in cardiac myocytes. The presented protocols specifically focus on steps involved in primary cardiac myocyte isolation, sample preparation, and imaging with details provided for experimental solutions and microscope settings. This discussion is followed by an overview of various analysis techniques to discern RyR2 organization within clusters and CRUs.},

We have applied the dSTORM variation of this method to image intracellular molecular assemblies in skeletal muscle fibres which are large cells that critically rely on nanoscale signalling domains, the triads. Immunofluorescence staining in fixed adult rat skeletal muscle sections revealed clear differences between fast- and slow-twitch fibres in the molecular organization of ryanodine receptors (RyRs; the primary calcium release channels) within triads. With the improved resolution offered by dSTORM, abutting arrays of RyRs in transverse view of fast fibres were observed in contrast to the fragmented distribution on slow-twitch muscle that were approximately 1.8 times shorter and consisted of approximately 1.6 times fewer receptors. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, we have quantified the nanometre-scale spatial association between triadic proteins using multi-colour super-resolution, an analysis difficult to conduct with electron microscopy. Our findings confirm that junctophilin-1 (JPH1), which tethers the sarcoplasmic reticulum ((SR) intracellular calcium store) to the tubular (t-) system at triads, was present throughout the RyR array, whereas JPH2 was contained within much smaller nanodomains. Similar imaging of the primary SR calcium buffer, calsequestrin (CSQ), detected less overlap of the triad with CSQ in slow-twitch muscle supporting greater spatial heterogeneity in the luminal Ca(2+) buffering when compared with fast twitch muscle. Taken together, these nanoscale differences can explain the fundamentally different physiologies of fast- and slow-twitch muscle.},

Voltage-clamped hair cells exhibited a P2 receptor pharmacology compatible with the assembly of ATP-gated ion channels from P2X(2) receptor subunits. Reverse transcription-PCR experiments confirmed expression of the P2X(2-1) receptor subunit mRNA isoform in the sensory epithelium (organ of Corti); a splice variant that confers desensitization, P2X(2-2), was the predominant subunit isoform expressed by primary auditory neurons. Expression of the ATP-gated ion channel protein was localized using a P2X(2) receptor subunit-specific antiserum. The highest density of P2X(2) subunit-like immunoreactivity in the cochlea occurred on the hair cell stereocilia, which faces the endolymph. Tissues lining this compartment exhibited significant P2X(2) receptor subunit expression, with the exception of the stria vascularis. Expression of ATP-gated ion channels at these sites provides a pathway for the observed ATP-induced reduction in endocochlear potential and likely serves a protective role, decoupling the "cochlear amplifier" in response to stressors, such as noise and ischemia. Within the perilymphatic compartment, immunolabeling on Deiters' cells is compatible with purinergic modulation of cochlear micromechanics. P2X(2) receptor subunit expression was also detected in spiral ganglion primary afferent neurons, and immunoelectron microscopy localized these subunits to postsynaptic junctions at both inner and outer hair cells. The former supports a cotransmitter role for ATP in a subset of type I spiral ganglion neurons, and latter represents the first characterization of a receptor for a fast neurotransmitter associated with the type II spiral ganglion neurons.},

	abstract = {Intra-sarcomeric gradients of [Ca2+] during activation of action potential stimulated frog single fibres were investigated with the Ca2+ indicator fluo-3 and confocal and two-photon microscopy. The object of these experiments was to look for evidence of extra-junctional Ca2+ release and examine the microscopic diffusion of Ca2+ within the sarcomere. By exploiting the spatial periodicity of sarcomeres within the fibre, we could achieve a high effective line-scanning rate ( approximately 8000 lines s-1), although the laser scanning microscope was limited to {\textless} 1000 lines s-1. At this high time resolution, the time course of fluorescence changes was very different at the z- and m-lines, with a significant delay ( approximately 1 ms; 22 C) between the rise of fluorescence at the z-line and the m-line. To calculate the expected fluorescence changes, we used a multi-compartment model of Ca2+ movements in the half-sarcomere in which Ca2+ release was restricted to triadic junctions (located at z-lines). Optical blurring by the microscope was simulated to generate fluorescence signals which could be compared directly to experimental data. The model which reproduced our experimental findings most accurately included Ca2+ binding by ATP, as well as indicator binding to immobile sarcomeric proteins. After taking sarcomeric misregistration within the fibre into account, there was very good agreement between the model and experimental results. We conclude that there is no experimental evidence for Ca2+ release at locations other than at z-lines. In addition, our calculations support the conclusion that rapidly diffusing Ca2+ buffers (such as ATP) are important in shaping the Ca2+ transient and that the details of intracellular indicator binding need to be considered to explain correctly the time course of fluorescence change in the fibre.},

	abstract = {House dust mite (HDM) allergens are important factors in the increasing prevalence of asthma. The lung epithelium forms a barrier that allergens must cross before they can cause sensitization. However, the mechanisms involved are unknown. Here we show that the cysteine proteinase allergen Der p 1 from fecal pellets of the HDM Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus causes disruption of intercellular tight junctions (TJs), which are the principal components of the epithelial paracellular permeability barrier. In confluent airway epithelial cells, Der p 1 led to cleavage of the TJ adhesion protein occludin. Cleavage was attenuated by antipain, but not by inhibitors of serine, aspartic, or matrix metalloproteinases. Putative Der p 1 cleavage sites were found in peptides from an extracellular domain of occludin and in the TJ adhesion protein claudin-1. TJ breakdown nonspecifically increased epithelial permeability, allowing Der p 1 to cross the epithelial barrier. Thus, transepithelial movement of Der p 1 to dendritic antigen-presenting cells via the paracellular pathway may be promoted by the allergen's own proteolytic activity. These results suggest that opening of TJs by environmental proteinases may be the initial step in the development of asthma to a variety of allergens.},

	abstract = {Using a Monte-Carlo model of L-type Ca2+ channel (DHPR) gating, we have examined the effect of changes in the early time course of the action potential as seen in human heart failure on excitation contraction coupling. The time course of DHPR Ca2+ influx was coupled into a simple model of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release. Our model shows that the loss of the initial spike in human heart failure should reduce the synchrony of Ca2+ spark production and lead to the appearance of late Ca2+ sparks and greater non-uniformity of intracellular Ca2+. Within the junctional space of the cardiac dyad, a small increase in the mean distance of a DHPR from a RyR results in a marked decrease in the ability of the DHPR-mediated increase in local [Ca2+] concentration to activate RyRs. This suggests that the efficiency of EC coupling may be reduced if changes in micro-architecture develop and such effects have been noted in experimental models of heart failure. High resolution imaging of t-tubules in tachycardia-induced heart failure show deranged t-tubule structure. While in normal human hearts t-tubules run mainly in a radial direction, t-tubules in the heart failure samples were oriented more toward the long axis of the cell. In addition, t-tubules may become dilated and bifurcated. Our data suggest that changes in the micro-architecture of the cell and membrane structures associated with excitation-contraction coupling, combined with changes in early action potential configuration can reduce the efficiency by which Ca2+ influx via DHPRs can activate SR calcium release and cardiac contraction. While the underlying cause of these effects is unclear, our data suggest that geometric factors can play an important role in the pathophysilogy of the human heart in failure.},

	abstract = {Two-photon excitation makes it possible to excite molecules in volumes of much less than 1 fl. In two-photon flash photolysis (TPFP) this property is used to release effector molecules from caged precursors with high three-dimensional resolution. We describe and examine the benefits of using TPFP in model solutions and in a number of cell systems to study their spatial and temporal properties. Using TPFP of caged fluorescein, we determined the free diffusion coefficient of fluorescein (D=4 x 0(-6) cm(2)/s at 20 degrees C, which is in close agreement with published values). TPFP of caged fluorescein in lens tissue in situ revealed spatial nonuniformities in intercellular fiber cell coupling by gap junctions. At the lens periphery, intercellular transport was predominantly directed along rows of cells, but was nearly isotropic further from the periphery. To test an algorithm aiming to reconstruct the Ca(2+) release flux underlying physiological Ca(2+) signals in heart muscle cells, TPFP of DM-Nitrophen was utilized to generate artificial microscopic Ca(2+) signals with known underlying Ca(2+) release flux. In an experiment with mouse oocytes, the recently developed Ca(2+) cage dimethoxynitrophenyl-ethyleneglycol-bis-(beta-aminoethylether)-N,N,N('),N(') tetraacetic acid-4 (DMNPE-4) was released in the oocyte cytosol and inside a nucleolus. Analysis of the resulting fluorescence changes suggested that the effective diffusion coefficient within the nucleolus was half of that in the cytosol.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To map changes in the structure and function of fiber cell gap junctions that occur with lens differentiation. METHODS: Equatorial lens sections were fluorescently labeled with antibodies to the gap junction protein connexin (Cx)46, the membrane marker wheat germ agglutinin, and the nuclear stain propidium iodide. Two-photon microscopy and digital image analysis were used to quantify label and cell morphology as a function of radial distance (r/a) across the lens. Loop- and tail-specific Cx46 antibodies were used to identify regions of posttranslational modification. Local fiber cell coupling was imaged in situ using two-photon flash photolysis of caged fluorescein. RESULTS: Antibody labeling showed that the cytoplasmic tail of Cx46 was removed in two zones (r/a approximately 0.9 and r/a approximately 0.7). In addition, with increasing depth, the large radially aligned plaques of peripheral fiber cells became fragmented and dispersed around the cell membrane, and cells became more circular in cross section. Fluorescein transfer between peripheral fiber cells was highly anisotropic and occurred predominantly within a column of fiber cells, resulting in radially directed transport. In regions beyond the zone of nuclear loss, transport was more isotropic and occurred across columns of fiber cells. CONCLUSIONS: The cleavage of Cx46 is associated with a spatial redistribution of gap junction plaques. The distribution of gap junction plaques around the cell membrane can explain the observed directionality of intercellular solute transfer. The findings suggest that the processing and redistribution of gap junction proteins is central to controlling radial and circumferential solute gradients in different regions within the lens.},

Using 2-photon molecular excitation microscopy and digital image-processing methods, we have obtained a comprehensive overview of the t-system of rat ventricular myocytes in living cells. We show that it is possible to quantify the morphology of the t-system in terms of average local tubule diameter, branching pattern, and local abundance of the t-system by immersing living myocytes in a dextran-linked fluorescein solution. Our data suggest that previous electron microscopic examinations of t-system structure have underestimated both the geometric complexity of the t-system morphology and the fraction of cell volume occupied by the t-system (3.6\% in this species). About 40\% of tubules occur between Z-lines, and the t-tubule diameter is 255+/-0.85 nm (mean+/-SEM). The t-tubules leave the outer surface of the cell in an approximately rectangular array; however, at some points junctions between the t-tubules and the surface membrane are missing. In view of the complexity of the t-system apparent from our images, we propose that the t-system be renamed the "sarcolemmal Z rete." The methods presented here are generally applicable to the quantification of the sarcolemmal Z rete and other structures within cells by fluorescence microscopy in a variety of cell types.},

	abstract = {Using a combination of experimental and numerical approaches, we have tested two different approaches to calculating the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release flux, which gives rise to cardiac muscle Ca2+ sparks. By using two-photon excited spot photolysis of DM-Nitrophen, known Ca2+ release flux time courses were generated to provide the first experimental validation of spark flux reconstruction algorithms. These artificial Ca2+ sparks show that it is possible to calculate the SR Ca2+ release waveform with reasonable accuracy, provided the flux equations reasonably reflect the properties of the experimental system. Within cardiac muscle cells, we show that Ca2+ flux reconstruction is complicated by the substantial dye binding to proteins, a factor that has not been adequately addressed in previous flux reconstruction algorithms. Furthermore, our numerical experiments suggest that the calculated time course of release flux inactivation based on conventional flux reconstruction algorithms is likely to be in error. We therefore developed novel algorithms based on an explicit dye binding scheme. When these algorithm were applied to evoked Ca2+ sparks in rat cardiac ventricular myocytes, the reconstructed Ca2+ release waveform peaked in {\textasciitilde}5 ms and decayed with a halftime of approximately 5 ms. The peak flux magnitude was 7-12 pA, suggesting that sparks must arise from clusters of {\textgreater}15 ryanodine receptors.},

	abstract = {Cardiac excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling describes the process that links sarcolemmal Ca2+ influx via L-type Ca2+ channels to Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum via ryanodine receptors (RyRs). This process has proven difficult to study experimentally, and complete descriptions of how the cell couples surface membrane and intracellular signal transduction proteins to achieve both stable and sensitive intracellular calcium release are still lacking. Mathematical models provide a framework to test our understanding of how this is achieved. While no single model is yet capable of describing all features of cardiac E-C coupling, models of increasing complexity are revealing unexpected subtlety in the process. In particular, modelling has established a general failure of 'common-pool' models and has emphasized the requirement for 'local control' so that microscopic sub-cellular domains can separate local behaviour from the whole-cell average (common-pool) behaviour. The micro-architecture of the narrow diadic cleft in which the local control takes place is a key factor in determining local Ca2+ dynamics. There is still considerable uncertainty about the number of Ca2+ ions required to open RyRs within the cleft and various gating models have been proposed, many of which are in reasonable agreement with available experimental data. However, not all models exhibit a realistic voltage dependence of E-C coupling gain. Furthermore, it is unclear which model features are essential to producing reasonable gain properties. Thus, despite the success of local-control models in explaining many features of cardiac E-C coupling, more work will be needed to provide a sound theoretical basis of cardiac E-C coupling.},

Collection volume is determined by the core dimensions and numerical aperture (NA) of the fiber and the scattering properties of the medium. For a multimode optical fiber with 100 mum core diam and NA=0.22, 80\% of the total fluorescence is collected from a depth of 170 mum in tissue and 465 mum in nonscattering fluid. A semiempirical mathematical description of photon flux adjacent to the fiber tip was also developed and validated.

The AC impedance spectrum showed an increased charge transfer resistance (Rct) and double layer capacitance of the sensor film after hybridisation.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04851v1},
	abstract = {Calcium plays a central role in mediating both contractile function and hypertrophic signalling in cardiomyocytes. While L-type Ca2+ channels (LCCs) trigger beat-to-beat release of calcium through ryanodine receptors (RyRs) for cellular contraction, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) have been implicated in releasing Ca2+ to modify beat-to-beat calcium to concurrently signal translocation of transcription factor NFAT into the nucleus to initiate hypertrophy. Details of both the generation and delivery of this translocation signal are unclear however. A recent study by Hannanta-anan and Chow has indicated that NFAT integrates the calcium signal over time. Their experiments revealed that an increase in the duration of elevated cytosolic calcium within each period of oscillation (increase in the duty cycle) increases NFAT-mediated gene transcription. However, it is not clear whether this mechanism exists in cardiac cells. Here we present a mathematical model of RyR and IP3R channel interaction which demonstrates that cytosolic IP3 is indeed capable of increasing the duty cycle of the calcium signal in the cardiomyocyte. Through comparison with published experimental results we demonstrate the importance of appropriately representing IP3R gating, verify that our model is capable of reproducing known disease phenotypes in the calcium transient through alteration of channel proportions, and examine how sensitive the cardiac cell is to IP3. A key result of our study is that increasing IP3 concentration increases calcium transient duration but may not always lead to positive inotropy. This work, together with the recent study by Hannanta-anan and Chow, suggests a plausible mechanism for IP3-dependent hypertrophic signalling in cardiomyocytes.},

	abstract = {Cardiomyocytes are among the largest of animal cell types. At {\textasciitilde}20 μm in typical width and {\textasciitilde}100 μm in length, these cells are intrinsically organised to contract rapidly and in synchrony in response to electrical activation. This excitation-contraction coupling (EC coupling) process is achieved through the synchronised opening of the primary calcium (Ca2+) release channels of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)—the ryanodine receptors (RyRs) [1]. A series of tubular membrane invaginations of the surface sarcolemma, known as the t-tubules, are the primary sites of this Ca2+ release deeper within the cell where RyRs are organised into clusters in quasi-crystalline patterns [2, 3]. Flanked between the t-tubule membrane and the SR membrane at the dyadic cleft, the cytoplasmic portions of these giant (29 nm × 29 nm) Ca2+ channel [4] are opened by the Ca2+ that enters the cleft through the voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channel (LCC). This process, known as Ca2+ induced Ca2+ release (CICR) crucially relies on the restricted diffusion and the consequently elevated concentration of the cleft Ca2+ [5]. Described in the theory of local control of EC coupling, the Ca2+ released via RyRs is likely a steep function of the dimensions of the dyadic cleft and the trigger Ca2+ concentration [6]. The synchronisation of the contraction also relies heavily on the effectiveness of this Ca2+ in reaching and activating the contractile machinery (which forms the myofibrils). Early light and electron micrographs have demonstrated that t-tubules and dyads are, to this end, organised all around the myofibrils to minimise the typical diffusional distance of the released calcium [7–10].},

This paper provides a comparative study of the quenching ability of an unmodified and a poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG)-modified Au surface, of the emission from an organic dye and from CdSe/ZnS QDs. PEG is a biocompatible molecule widely used for modification of different surfaces when protein resistance is required. Fluorescence measurements show that both an unmodified and a PEG-modified Au surface are able to quench the emission from the dye and the QDs. Some interactions between the QDs and the unmodified An surface were also observed, although the interactions are significantly suppressed by the presence of PEG. The PEG-modified Au surface is suitable for further applications, involving biomolecules, where its efficient quenching ability and protein resistivity can be utilized. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Confocal laser scanning microscopy and super-resolution microscopy provide high-contrast and high-resolution fluorescent imaging, which has great potential to increase the diagnostic yield of endomyocardial biopsy (EMB). EMB is currently the gold standard for identification of cardiac allograft rejection, myocarditis, and infiltrative and storage diseases. However, standard analysis is dominated by low-contrast bright-field light and electron microscopy (EM); this lack of contrast makes quantification of pathological features difficult. For example, assessment of cardiac allograft rejection relies on subjective grading of H\&E histology, which may lead to diagnostic variability between pathologists. This issue could be solved by utilising the high contrast provided by fluorescence methods such as confocal to quantitatively assess the degree of lymphocytic infiltrate. For infiltrative diseases such as amyloidosis, the nanometre resolution provided by EM can be diagnostic in identifying disease-causing fibrils. The recent advent of super-resolution imaging, particularly direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), provides high-contrast imaging at resolution approaching that of EM. Moreover, dSTORM utilises conventional fluorescence dyes allowing for the same structures to be routinely imaged at the cellular scale and then at the nanoscale. The key benefit of these technologies is that the high contrast facilitates quantitative digital analysis and thereby provides a means to robustly assess critical pathological features. Ultimately, this technology has the ability to provide greater accuracy and precision to EMB assessment, which could result in better outcomes for patients.},

It was established that the mechanism of microsphere formation is based on polymer growth on preformed micelles, which could be seen in freeze-fracture experiments.

	abstract = {Quantitative understanding of the Ca(2+) handling in cardiac ventricular myocytes requires accurate knowledge of cardiac ultrastructure and protein distribution. We have therefore developed high-resolution imaging and analysis approaches to measure the three-dimensional distribution of immunolabelled proteins with confocal microscopy. Labelling of single rat cardiac myocytes with an antibody to the Z-line marker alpha-actinin revealed a complex architecture of sarcomere misalignment across single cells. Double immunolabelling was used to relate the Z-line structure to the distribution of ryanodine receptors (RyRs, the intracellular Ca(2+) release channels) and the transverse tubular system. Both RyR and transverse tubular system distributions exhibited frequent dislocations from the simple planar geometry generally assumed in existing mathematical models. To investigate potential effects of these irregularities on Ca(2+) dynamics, we determined the three-dimensional distribution of RyR clusters within an extended section of a single rat ventricular myocyte to construct a model of stochastic Ca(2+) dynamics with a measured Ca(2+) release unit (CRU) distribution. Calculations with this model were compared with a second model in which all CRUs were placed on flat planes. The model with a realistic CRU distribution supported Ca(2+) waves that spread axially along the cell at velocities of approximately 50 mum s(-1). By contrast, in the model with planar CRU distribution the axial wave spread was slowed roughly twofold and wave propagation often nearly faltered. These results demonstrate that spatial features of the CRU distribution on multiple length scales may significantly affect intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics and must be captured in detailed mechanistic models to achieve quantitative as well as qualitative insight.},

This observation provides the basis for an imaging technique we call reversible photobleaching microscopy. We demonstrate applicability of this technique using antibody labeled biological samples in standard aqueous (or glycerol based) media to produce far-field images at approximately 30 nm resolution. Our novel method relies on intense illumination to reversibly induce a very long-lived ({\textgreater}10 s) dark state from which single fluorochromes slowly return stochastically. As in other localization microscopy methods, reversible photobleaching microscopy localizes single fluorochromes, but has the advantage that specialized photoactivatible and photoswitchable molecules or special immersion/embedding media are not required.},

	abstract = {Using deconvolved confocal microscopy of fluorescently labeled markers for z-disks, t-tubules and ryanodine receptors, we have examined sarcomere organization in cardiac myocytes from rat, rabbit and human. We show that sarcomeres exhibit dislocations in registration and occasionally more complex helicoidal topology. This organization was present at both slack ( approximately 1.8 mum) and long sarcomere lengths ( approximately 2.2 mum). Misregistrations in z-disks persisted over 15-20 sarcomere lengths and appeared to arise primarily from variations in fiber direction; particularly as myofibrils pass around nuclei. In addition, myofibrils twist along the cell length. T-tubules generally follow the sarcomere z-disks although additional elements bridging adjacent myofibrils and along the length of the myofibril are present to varying degrees in all cells. Ryanodine receptors (the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release channel) are generally located within 250 nm of the local plane containing t-tubules and z-disks, but a small fraction ( approximately 2\%) is found on longitudinal elements of the t-system between z-disks. The results are discussed with respect to the possible role(s) of such complex z-disk organization and z-disk dislocations in the maintenance of cell structure and sarcomere assembly. In addition, the non-planar organization of z-disks may be important in the propagation of local Ca(2+) waves which may have a useful role in helping maintain the uniformity of sarcomere activation in the presence of t-tubule remodeling.},

RyRs form clusters with a mean size of approximately 14 RyRs per cluster, which is almost an order of magnitude smaller than previously estimated. Clusters were typically not circular (as previously assumed) but elongated with an average aspect ratio of 1.9. Edge-to-edge distances between adjacent RyR clusters were often {\textless}50 nm, suggesting that peripheral RyR clusters may exhibit strong intercluster signaling. The wide variation of cluster size, which follows a near-exponential distribution, is compatible with a stochastic cluster assembly process. We suggest that calcium sparks may be the result of the concerted activation of several RyR clusters forming a functional "supercluster" whose gating is controlled by both cytosolic and sarcoplasmic reticulum luminal calcium levels.},

Transverse and longitudinal optical sectioning shows that NCX is distributed widely along the transverse and longitudinal tubular system (t-system). The NCX labeling consisted of both punctate and distributed components, which partially colocalize with RyRs (27\%). Surface membrane labeling showed a similar pattern but the fraction of RyR clusters containing NCX label was decreased and no nonpunctate labeling was observed. Sixteen percent of RyRs were not colocalized with the t-system and 1.6\% of RyRs were found on longitudinal elements of the t-system. The surface distribution of RyR labeling was not generally consistent with circular patches of RyRs. This suggests that previous estimates for the number of RyRs in a junction (based on circular close-packed arrays) need to be revised. The observed distribution of caveolin-3 labeling was consistent with its exclusion from RyR clusters. Distance maps for all colocalization pairs were calculated to give the distance between centroids of punctate labeling and edges for distributed components. The possible roles for punctate NCX labeling are discussed.},

The mechanism and physiological significance of JPH2 in regulating RyR2-mediated SR Ca(2+) leak remains elusive. We sought to elucidate the role of JPH2 in regulating RyR2-mediated SR Ca(2+) release in the setting of cardiac failure. Cardiac myocytes isolated from tamoxifen-inducible conditional knockdown mice of JPH2 (MCM-shJPH2) were subjected to confocal Ca(2+) imaging. MCM-shJPH2 cardiomyocytes exhibited an increased spark frequency width with altered spark morphology, which caused increased SR Ca(2+) leakage. Single channel studies identified an increased RyR2 open probability in MCM-shJPH2 mice. The increase in spark frequency and width was observed only in MCM-shJPH2 and not found in mice with increased RyR2 open probability with native JPH2 expression. Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchanger (NCX) activity was reduced by 50\% in MCM-shJPH2 with no detectable change in NCX expression. Additionally, 50\% inhibition of NCX through Cd(2+) administration alone was sufficient to increase spark width in myocytes obtained from wild-type mice. Additionally, superresolution analysis of RyR2 and NCX colocalization showed a reduced overlap between RyR2 and NCX in MCM-shJPH2 mice. In conclusion, decreased JPH2 expression causes increased SR Ca(2+) leakage by directly increasing open probability of RyR2 and by indirectly reducing junctional NCX activity through increased dyadic cleft Ca(2+). This demonstrates two novel and independent cellular mechanisms by which JPH2 regulates RyR2-mediated SR Ca(2+) leak and heart failure development.},

A full cell simulation integrating about 10,000 Ca2+ release units (CRUs) in a typical cardiac myocyte is considered a multi-scale, computationally demanding problem. In this paper, we imported an experimentally obtained spatial distribution of Ryanodine Receptor (RyR) clusters into a spatially extended, stochastic model of intracellular Ca2+ dynamics, to investigate the role of the structural bifurcation of Z-disks on the initiation and propagation of intracellular Ca2+ waves from spatially symmetric Ca2+ sparks. Besides, we also proposed a simple parallelization strategy to increase computational speed for this challenging problem in cardiac modelling.},

	abstract = {The contractile properties of cardiac myocytes depend on the calcium (Ca(2+)) released by clusters of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) throughout the myoplasm. Accurate quantification of the spatial distribution of RyRs has previously been challenging due to the comparatively low resolution in optical microscopy. We have combined single-molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM) in a super-resolution modality known as dSTORM with immunofluorescence staining of tissue sections of rat ventricles to resolve a wide, near-exponential size distribution of RyR clusters that lined on average {\textasciitilde}57\% of the perimeter of each myofibril. The average size of internal couplons is {\textasciitilde}63 RyRs (nearly 4 times larger than that of peripheral couplons) and the largest clusters contain many hundreds of RyRs. Similar to previous observations in peripheral couplons, we observe many clusters with one or few receptors; however ≥80\% of the total RyRs were detected in clusters containing ≥100 receptors. {\textasciitilde}56\% of all clusters were within an edge-to-edge distance sufficiently close to co-activate via Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (100nm) and were grouped into 'superclusters'. The co-location of superclusters with the same or adjacent t-tubular connections in dual-colour super-resolution images suggested that member sub-clusters may be exposed to similar local luminal Ca(2+) levels. Dual-colour dSTORM revealed high co-localisation between the cardiac junctional protein junctophilin-2 (JPH2) and RyR clusters that confirmed that the majority of the RyR clusters observed are dyadic. The increased sensitivity of super-resolution images revealed approximately twice as many RyR clusters (2.2clusters/μm(3)) compared to previous confocal measurements. We show that, in general, the differences of previous confocal estimates are largely attributable to the limited spatial resolution of diffraction-limited imaging. The new data can be used to inform the construction of detailed mechanistic models of cardiac Ca(2+) signalling.},

	abstract = {AIMS:Therapeutic advances in prevention and treatment of myocardial infarction (MI) have decreased patient mortality and increased concern about efficient repair and scar formation, processes that are necessary to attenuate complications such as adverse remodelling and heart failure. Since the rapid accumulation and activity of cardiac fibroblasts is critical for proper scar formation, we hypothesized that infarct fibroblasts are generated by a cardiac-resident progenitor cell population.

METHODS AND RESULTS:We found that infarct fibroblasts in C57BL/6 mice are generated by a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) population that responds robustly to injury by proliferating and accumulating in the infarct. We report that stem cell-derived fibroblasts contribute to the formation of a scar after an infarction by differentiating into matrix-producing fibroblasts closely associated with fibrillar collagen in the infarct. Further characterization of these cells revealed a heterogenous population with expression of both stem cell and canonical cardiac fibroblast markers, suggesting that some have a commitment to the fibroblast phenotype. Our in vitro study of these cells shows that they have extended self-renewal capability and express the primitive marker Nanog. In keeping with these observations, we also report that these cells are multipotent and differentiate readily into fibroblasts as well as other mesenchymal lineages.

CONCLUSION:Cells with the properties of MSCs participate in wound healing after MI in the adult heart.},

	abstract = {Evidence from animal models suggest that t-tubule changes may play an important role in the contractile deficit associated with heart failure. However samples are usually taken at random with no regard as to regional variability present in failing hearts which leads to uncertainty in the relationship between contractile performance and possible t-tubule derangement. Regional contraction in human hearts was measured by tagged cine MRI and model fitting. At transplant, failing hearts were biopsy sampled in identified regions and immunocytochemistry was used to label t-tubules and sarcomeric z-lines. Computer image analysis was used to assess 5 different unbiased measures of t-tubule structure/organization. In regions of failing hearts that showed good contractile performance, t-tubule organization was similar to that seen in normal hearts, with worsening structure correlating with the loss of regional contractile performance. Statistical analysis showed that t-tubule direction was most highly correlated with local contractile performance, followed by the amplitude of the sarcomeric peak in the Fourier transform of the t-tubule image. Other area based measures were less well correlated. We conclude that regional contractile performance in failing human hearts is strongly correlated with the local t-tubule organization. Cluster tree analysis with a functional definition of failing contraction strength allowed a pathological definition of 't-tubule disease'. The regional variability in contractile performance and cellular structure is a confounding issue for analysis of samples taken from failing human hearts, although this may be overcome with regional analysis by using tagged cMRI and biopsy mapping.},

	abstract = {Many biological questions require information at different spatial scales that include molecular, organelle, cell and tissue scales. Here we detail a method of multi-scale imaging of human cardiac tissue by correlatively combining nano-scale data of direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) with cellular and tissue level data provided by confocal microscopy. By utilising conventional fluorescence dyes the same cellular structures can be imaged with both modalities. Human cardiac tissue was first imaged at the nanoscale to identify macro-molecular membrane complexes containing the cardiac muscle proteins junctophilin (JPH) and the ryanodine receptor (RyR). The distribution of these proteins and an additional cell membrane marker (wheat germ agglutinin, WGA) were subsequently imaged by confocal microscopy. By segmenting dSTORM data into membrane and non-membrane components we demonstrate increased colocalization of RyR with JPH at the plasma-membrane as compared to intracellular compartments. Strategies for antibody labelling, quality control, locating and aligning structures between modalities, and analysis of combined multi-scaled data sets are described.},

	abstract = {Intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics provides excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac myocytes. Under pathological conditions, spontaneous Ca(2+) release events can lead to intracellular Ca(2+) travelling waves, which can break, giving transitory or persistent intracellular re-entrant Ca(2+) scroll waves. Intracellular Ca(2+) waves can trigger cellular delayed after-depolarizations of membrane potential, which if they occur in a cluster of a few hundred neighbouring myocytes may lead to cardiac arrhythmia. Quantitative prediction of the initiation and propagation of intracellular Ca(2+) waves requires the dynamics of Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release, and the intracellular spatial distribution of Ca(2+) release units (CRUs). The spatial distribution of ryanodine receptor clusters within a few sarcomeres was reconstructed directly from confocal imaging measurements. It was then embedded into a three-dimensional ventricular cell model, with a resting membrane potential and simple stochastic Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release dynamics. Isotropic global Ca(2+) wave propagation can be produced within the anisotropic intracellular architecture, by isotropic local Ca(2+) diffusion, and the branching Z-disc structure providing inter Z-disc pathways for Ca(2+) propagation. The branching Z-disc provides a broader spatial distribution of ryanodine receptor clusters across Z-discs, which reduces the likelihood of wave initiation by spontaneous Ca(2+) releases. Intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics during catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) was simulated phenomenologically by increasing the Ca(2+) sensitivity factor of the CRU, which results in an increased rate of Ca(2+) release events. Flecainide has been shown to prevent arrhythmias in a murine model of CPVT and in patients. The modelled actions of flecainide on the time course of Ca(2+) release events prevented the initiation of Ca(2+) waves.},

This study focuses on the response of an electrochemical, CdTe nanoparticle-modified hairpin DNA sensor. The stem-loop structured probes and the blocking poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) molecules were self-assembled on the gold electrode through S-Au bonding, to form a mixed monolayer employed as the sensing platform. Water-soluble CdTe nanoparticles were covalently attached to the hairpin probes (HPPs) and impedance spectroscopy was used for investigation of the electron transfer processes at a modified gold electrode before and after hybridization with the target DNA. The sensor showed reliable and sensitive detection of 4.7 fM of target. Although the selectivity of the sensor towards one-base mismatch targets needs to be improved, discrimination of non-complementary targets was achieved.},

Here, we have examined two transgenic murine models probing the role of junctophilin-2, a membrane-tethering protein crucial for the formation and molecular organisation of sub-microscopic junctions in ventricular muscle cells of the heart. Quantitative single-molecule localisation microscopy showed that junctions in animals producing above-normal levels of junctophilin-2 were enlarged, allowing the re-organisation of the primary functional protein within it, the ryanodine receptor (RyR; in this paper, we use RyR to refer to the myocardial isoform RyR2). Although this change was associated with much enlarged RyR clusters that, due to their size, should be more excitable, functionally it caused a mild inhibition in the Ca(2+) signalling output of the junctions (Ca(2+) sparks). Analysis of the single-molecule densities of both RyR and junctophilin-2 revealed an ∼3-fold increase in the junctophilin-2 to RyR ratio. This molecular rearrangement is compatible with direct inhibition of RyR opening by junctophilin-2 to intrinsically stabilise the Ca(2+) signalling properties of the junction and thus the contractile function of the cell.},

Here, we combined morphological techniques, super-resolution imaging, and proteomic profiling to reveal the detailed cellular and molecular architecture of the human NMJ. Human NMJs were significantly smaller, less complex, and more fragmented than mouse NMJs. In contrast to mice, human NMJs were also remarkably stable across the entire adult lifespan, showing no signs of age-related degeneration or remodeling. Super-resolution imaging and proteomic profiling revealed distinctive distribution of active zone proteins and differential expression of core synaptic proteins and molecular pathways at the human NMJ. Taken together, these findings reveal human-specific cellular and molecular features of the NMJ that distinguish them from comparable synapses in other mammalian species.},

Two important aspects of telomeres are their length in DNA base pairs (bps) and their biophysical nanometer dimensions. However, there are currently no techniques that can simultaneously measure these quantities in individual cell nuclei. Here, we develop and evaluate a telomere "dual" gold nanoparticle-fluorescent probe simultaneously compatible with both X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and super resolution microscopy. We used silver enhancement to independently visualize the spatial locations of gold nanoparticles inside the nuclei, comparing to a standard QFISH (quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization) probe, and showed good specificity at ∼90\%. For sensitivity, we calculated telomere length based on a DNA/gold binding ratio using XRF and compared to quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) measurements. The sensitivity was low (∼10\%), probably because of steric interference prohibiting the relatively large 10 nm gold nanoparticles access to DNA space. We then measured the biophysical characteristics of individual telomeres using super resolution microscopy. Telomeres that have an average length of ∼10 kbps, have diameters ranging between ∼60-300 nm. Further, we treated cells with a telomere-shortening drug and showed there was a small but significant difference in telomere diameter in drug-treated vs control cells. We discuss our results in relation to the current debate surrounding telomere compaction.},

	abstract = {We conducted super-resolution light microscopy (LM) imaging of the distribution of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and caveolin-3 (CAV3) in mouse ventricular myocytes. Quantitative analysis of data at the surface sarcolemma showed that 4.8\% of RyR labeling colocalized with CAV3 whereas 3.5\% of CAV3 was in areas with RyR labeling. These values increased to 9.2 and 9.0\%, respectively, in the interior of myocytes where CAV3 was widely expressed in the t-system but reduced in regions associated with junctional couplings. Electron microscopic (EM) tomography independently showed only few couplings with caveolae and little evidence for caveolar shapes on the t-system. Unexpectedly, both super-resolution LM and three-dimensional EM data (including serial block-face scanning EM) revealed significant increases in local t-system diameters in many regions associated with junctions. We suggest that this regional specialization helps reduce ionic accumulation and depletion in t-system lumen during excitation-contraction coupling to ensure effective local Ca²⁺ release. Our data demonstrate that super-resolution LM and volume EM techniques complementarily enhance information on subcellular structure at the nanoscale.},

In cardiac ventricular myocytes RyRs and associated Ca(2+) handling proteins, including membrane Ca(2+) channels, Ca(2+) pumps and other sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins interact to set the time course and amplitude of the electrically triggered cytosolic Ca(2+) transient. It has become increasingly clear that protein distribution and clustering on the nanometer scale is critical in determining the interaction of these proteins and the resulting properties of cardiac Ca(2+) handling. Such intricate near-molecular scale detail cannot be visualized with conventional fluorescence microscopy techniques (e.g. confocal microscopy) but it has recently become accessible with optical super-resolution techniques. These techniques retain the advantages of fluorescent marker technology, i.e. high specificity and excellent contrast, but have a spatial resolution approaching 10nm, i.e. objects not much further apart than 10nm can be distinguished, previously only attainable with electron microscopy. We review the use of these novel imaging techniques for the study of protein distribution in cardiac ventricular myocytes and discuss technical considerations as well as recent findings using super-resolution imaging. An emphasis is on single molecule localization based super-resolution approaches and their use to reveal the complexity of RyR cluster morphology, placement and relationship to other excitation-contraction coupling proteins. Super-resolution imaging approaches have already demonstrated their utility for the study of cardiac structure-function relationships and we anticipate that their use will rapidly increase and help improve our understanding of cardiac Ca(2+) regulation.},

There is now a large body of evidence in animal models and humans demonstrating that pathological distortion of the t-tubule structure has a causative role in the loss of myocyte contractility that underpins many forms of heart failure. Investigations into the molecular mechanisms of pathological t-tubule remodelling to date have focused on proteins residing in the intracellular aspect of t-tubule membrane that form linkages between the membrane and myocyte cytoskeleton. In this review, we shed light on the mechanisms of t-tubule remodelling which are not limited to the intracellular side. Our recent data have demonstrated that collagen is an integral part of the t-tubule network and that it increases within the tubules in heart failure, suggesting that a fibrotic mechanism could drive cardiac junctional remodelling. We examine the evidence that the linkages between the extracellular matrix, t-tubule membrane and cellular cytoskeleton should be considered as a whole when investigating the mechanisms of t-tubule pathology in the failing heart.},

	abstract = {Aims:In heart failure transverse-tubule (t-tubule) remodelling disrupts calcium release, and contraction. T-tubules in human failing hearts exhibit increased labelling by wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), a lectin that binds to the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex. We hypothesized changes in this complex may explain the increased WGA labelling and contribute to t-tubule remodelling in the failing human heart. In this study we sought to identify the molecules responsible for this increased WGA labelling.

Methods and results:Confocal and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy and proteomic analyses were used to quantify left ventricle samples from healthy donors and patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM). Confocal microscopy demonstrated both WGA and dystrophin were located at t-tubules. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that WGA labelling of t-tubules is largely located within the lumen while dystrophin was restricted to near the sarcolemma. Western blots probed with WGA reveal a 5.7-fold increase in a 140 kDa band in IDCM. Mass spectrometry identified this band as type VI collagen (Col-VI) comprised of α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI) chains. Pertinently, mutations in Col-VI cause muscular dystrophy. Western blotting identified a 2.4-fold increased expression and 3.2-fold increased WGA binding of Col-VI in IDCM. Confocal images showed that Col-VI is located in the t-tubules and that their diameter increased in the IDCM samples. Super-resolution imaging revealed Col-VI was restricted to the t-tubule lumen where increases were associated with displacement in the sarcolemma as identified from dystrophin labelling. Samples were also labelled for type I, III, and IV collagen. Both confocal and super-resolution imaging identified that these collagens were also present within t-tubule lumen.

Conclusion:Increased expression and labelling of collagen in IDCM samples indicates fibrosis may contribute to t-tubule remodelling in human heart failure.},

Examples include calcium release sites of cardiomyocytes where ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are clustered with their molecular partners. Localization microscopy has been crucial to visualizing these nanodomains but has been limited by brightness of markers, restricting the resolution and quantification of individual proteins clustered within. Harnessing the remarkable localization precision of DNA-PAINT ({\textless}10 nm), we visualized punctate labeling within these nanodomains, confirmed as single RyRs. RyR positions within sub-plasmalemmal nanodomains revealed how they are organized randomly into irregular clustering patterns leaving significant gaps occupied by accessory or regulatory proteins. RyR-inhibiting protein junctophilin-2 appeared highly concentrated adjacent to RyR channels. Analyzing these molecular maps showed significant variations in the co-clustering stoichiometry between junctophilin-2 and RyR, even between nearby nanodomains. This constitutes an additional level of complexity in RyR arrangement and regulation of calcium signaling, intrinsically built into the nanodomains.},

	abstract = {Cell wall appositions (CWAs) are produced reactively by the plant immune system to arrest microbial invasion through the local inversion of plant cell growth. This process requires the controlled invagination of the plasma membrane (PM) in coordination with the export of barrier material to the volume between the plant PM and cell wall. Plant actin dynamics are essential to this response, but it remains unclear how exocytosis and the cytoskeleton are linked in space and time to form functional CWAs. Here, we show that actin-dependent trafficking to immune response sites of Arabidopsis thaliana delivers membrane-integrated FORMIN4, which in turn contributes to local cytoskeletal dynamics. Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy combined with controlled induction of FORMIN4-GFP expression reveals a dynamic population of vesicular bodies that accumulate to form clusters at the PM through an actin-dependent process. Deactivation of FORMIN4 and its close homologs partially compromises subsequent defense and alters filamentous actin (F-actin) distribution at mature CWAs. The localization of FORMIN4 is stable and segregated from the dynamic traffic of the endosomal network. Moreover, the tessellation of FORMIN4 at the PM with meso-domains of PEN3 reveals a fine spatial segregation of destinations for actin-dependent immunity cargo. Together, our data suggest a model where FORMIN4 is a spatial feedback element in a multi-layered, temporally defined sequence of cytoskeletal response. This positional feedback makes a significant contribution to the distribution of actin filaments at the dynamic CWA boundary and to the outcomes of pre-invasion defense.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Among the growing numbers of patients with heart failure, up to one half have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The lack of effective treatments for HFpEF is a substantial and escalating unmet clinical need-and the lack of HFpEF-specific animal models represents a major preclinical barrier in advancing understanding of HFpEF. As established treatments for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) have proven ineffective for HFpEF, the contention that the intrinsic cardiomyocyte phenotype is distinct in these 2 conditions requires consideration. Our goal was to validate and characterize a new rodent model of HFpEF, undertaking longitudinal investigations to delineate the associated cardiac and cardiomyocyte pathophysiology.

METHODS AND RESULTS:The selectively inbred Hypertrophic Heart Rat (HHR) strain exhibits adult cardiac enlargement (without hypertension) and premature death (40\% mortality at 50 weeks) compared to its control strain, the normal heart rat. Hypertrophy was characterized in vivo by maintained systolic parameters (ejection fraction at 85\%-90\% control) with marked diastolic dysfunction (increased E/E'). Surprisingly, HHR cardiomyocytes were hypercontractile, exhibiting high Ca2+ operational levels and markedly increased L-type Ca2+ channel current. In HHR, prominent regions of reparative fibrosis in the left ventricle free wall adjacent to the interventricular septum were observed.

CONCLUSIONS:Thus, the cardiomyocyte remodeling process in the etiology of this HFpEF model contrasts dramatically with the suppressed Ca2+ cycling state that typifies heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. These findings may explain clinical observations, that treatments considered appropriate for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction are of little benefit for HFpEF-and suggest a basis for new therapeutic strategies.},

The effect of the optical train on illumination pulse width was examined and the observed increase in pulse duration was almost completely removed by the addition/adjustment of a prism compressor system. The imaging capabilities of the two-photon microscope are demonstrated and it is shown that the imaging performance of the two-photon microscope is similar to that of a conventional confocal microscope. With two-photon illumination, the resolution (full width at half-maximum intensity) was 0.42 microM (x-y) and 0.81 microM axially, while with single-photon illumination (at 488 nm in the same instrument with a confocal pinhole detector) the resolution was 0.3 microM (x-y) and 0.75 microM axially. The results are discussed with regard to the general problem of femtosecond pulse distortion in an optical system and a simple procedure for optimal pulse restoration is described.},

The algorithm proved to give reliable reconstructions from experimentally measured projection data in the case of an unrestricted angular view. The method was used for the reconstruction of density distributions of weakly perturbed supersonic free jets exiting from a deformed Laval nozzle. Even small perturbations of the jet resulted in significant three-dimensional effects. Reconstruction of a multiple system of jets emanating from a sievelike nozzle showed mutual interactions between the constituent jets. For the investigation of unsteady flows a setup for the recording of holographic interferograms was designed. Here, because of experimental restrictions, only a limited angular range of views was accessible. In the context of this limited-view geometry, reconstructions revealed considerable distortions for objects containing steep gradients.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Eukaryotic cell division requires the mitotic spindle, a microtubule (MT)-based structure which accurately aligns and segregates duplicated chromosomes. The dynamics of spindle formation are determined primarily by correctly localising the MT nucleator, γ-Tubulin Ring Complex (γ-TuRC)1-4, within the cell. A conserved MT-associated protein complex, Augmin, recruits γ-TuRC to pre-existing spindle MTs, amplifying their number, in an essential cellular phenomenon termed branched MT nucleation5-9. Here, we purify endogenous, GFP-tagged Augmin and γ-TuRC from Drosophila embryos to near homogeneity using a novel one-step affinity technique. We demonstrate that, in vitro, while Augmin alone does not affect Tubulin polymerisation dynamics, it stimulates γ-TuRC-dependent MT nucleation in a cell cycle-dependent manner. We also assemble and visualise the MT-Augmin-γ-TuRC-MT junction using light microscopy. Our work therefore conclusively reconstitutes branched MT nucleation. It also provides a powerful synthetic approach with which to investigate the emergence of cellular phenomena, such as mitotic spindle formation, from component parts.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Unlike conventional optical microscopies, localization microscopy experiments do not generate an image but a list of discrete coordinates of estimated fluorophore positions. Data display and analysis therefore generally require visualization methods that translate the position data into conventional images. Here we investigate the properties of several widely used visualization techniques and show that a commonly used algorithm based on rendering Gaussians may lead to a 1.44-fold loss of resolution. Existing methods typically do not explicitly take sampling considerations into account and thus may produce spurious structures. We present two additional visualization algorithms, an adaptive histogram method based on quad-trees and a Delaunay triangulation based visualization of point data that address some of these deficiencies. The new visualization methods are designed to suppress erroneous detail in poorly sampled image areas but avoid loss of resolution in well-sampled regions. A number of criteria for scoring visualization methods are developed as a guide for choosing among visualization methods and are used to qualitatively compare various algorithms.},

Test samples can provide regular feedback on system performance and facilitate the implementation of new methods. While multiple test samples for regular, 2D imaging are available, they are not common for more specialised imaging modes. Here, we analyse robust test samples for 3D and quantitative super-resolution imaging, which are straightforward to use, are time- and cost-effective and do not require experience beyond basic laboratory and imaging skills. We present two options for assessment of 3D imaging quality, the use of microspheres functionalised for DNA-PAINT and a commercial DNA origami sample. A method to establish and assess a qPAINT workflow for quantitative imaging is demonstrated with a second, commercially available DNA origami sample.},

	abstract = {Calcium signalling plays a pivotal role in cardiomyocytes, coupling electrical excitation to mechanical contraction of the heart. Determining locations of active calcium release sites, and how their recruitment changes in response to stimuli and in disease states is therefore of central interest in cardiac physiology. Current algorithms for detecting release sites from live cell imaging data are however not easily validated against a known ‘ground truth’, which makes interpretation of the output of such algorithms, in particular the degree of confidence in site detection, a challenging task. Computational models are capable of integrating findings from multiple sources into a consistent, predictive framework. In cellular physiology, such models have the potential to reveal structure and function beyond the temporal and spatial resolution limitations of individual experimental measurements. Here, we create a spatially detailed computational model of calcium release in an eight sarcomere section of a ventricular cardiomyocyte, using electron tomography reconstruction of cardiac ultrastructure and and confocal imaging of protein localisation. This provides a high-resolution model of calcium diffusion from intracellular stores, which can be used as a platform to simulate confocal fluorescence imaging in the context of known ground truth structures from the higher resolution model. We use this capability to evaluate the performance of a recently proposed method for detecting the functional response of calcium release sites in live cells. Model permutations reveal how calcium release site density and mitochondria acting as diffusion barriers affect site detection performance of the algorithm. We demonstrate that site density has the greatest impact on detection precision and recall, in particular affecting the effective detectable depth of sites in confocal data. Our findings provide guidance on how such detection algorithms may best be applied to experimental data and give insights into limitations when using two-dimensional microscopy images to analyse three-dimensional cellular structures.},

	abstract = {Nanodomains are intracellular foci which transduce signals between major cellular compartments. One of the most ubiquitous signal transducers, the ryanodine receptor (RyR) calcium channel, is tightly clustered within these nanodomains. Super-resolution microscopy has previously been used to visualize RyR clusters near the cell surface. A majority of nanodomains located deeper within cells have remained unresolved due to limited imaging depths and axial resolution of these modalities. A series of enhancements made to expansion microscopy allowed individual RyRs to be resolved within planar nanodomains at the cell periphery and the curved nanodomains located deeper within the interiors of cardiomyocytes. With a resolution of ∼ 15 nm, we localized both the position of RyRs and their individual phosphorylation for the residue Ser2808. With a three-dimensional imaging protocol, we observed disturbances to the RyR arrays in the nanometer scale which accompanied right-heart failure caused by pulmonary hypertension. The disease coincided with a distinct gradient of RyR hyperphosphorylation from the edge of the nanodomain toward the center, not seen in healthy cells. This spatial profile appeared to contrast distinctly from that sustained by the cells during acute, physiological hyperphosphorylation when they were stimulated with a β-adrenergic agonist. Simulations of RyR arrays based on the experimentally determined channel positions and phosphorylation signatures showed how the nanoscale dispersal of the RyRs during pathology diminishes its intrinsic likelihood to ignite a calcium signal. It also revealed that the natural topography of RyR phosphorylation could offset potential heterogeneity in nanodomain excitability which may arise from such RyR reorganization.},

	abstract = {Excitation-contraction coupling in the heart crucially depends on the function of ryanodine receptors (RyRs). Recent advances in single-molecule localization microscopy have enabled nanoscale visualization of RyR organization, yet the precise geometric arrangement of RyRs in both health and disease has yet to be characterized. Here, we employed our recently developed 3D dSTORM method to quantify the subcellular, nanoscale organization of RyRs in normal and failing (post-infarction) rat cardiomyocytes, proposing that disassembly of RyR clusters promotes impaired Ca 2+ homeostasis in this condition. We specifically investigated the nanoscale organization of interior RyRs which are associated with the transverse tubule network; a subpopulation of RyRs that can only be quantitatively characterized in 3D. We observed a significant reduction in RyR cluster size in failing cardiomyocytes when compared to sham-operated controls (5.0±0.3 vs. 7.8±0.4 RyRs/cluster, p{\textless}0.05). RyR cluster groupings localized within 100 nm of their neighbours comprise Ca2+ release units (CRUs), which are thought to cooperatively generate Ca 2+ sparks. 3D imaging revealed an average of 21±0.9 RyRs/CRU in sham cells, but only 15.1±1.3 RyRs/CRU in failing cells (p{\textless}0.05). Failing cardiomyocytes also contained more RyR clusters / CRU than sham cells (2.7±0.1 vs 2.9±0.1, p{\textless}0.05), associated with slower Ca 2+ spark kinetics (time to peak = 7.7±0.5 vs 10.5±0.4, p{\textless}0.05). When failing cardiomyocytes were treated with a CaMKII blocker (Autocamtide-1-related Inhibitory Peptide, AIP), Ca 2+ spark characteristics were restored to sham levels. AIP administration also reversed the RyR dispersal observed at both the cluster and CRU level. Importantly, stimulation of CaMKII by the EPAC activator 8-CPT reproduced RyR dispersion in healthy cardiomyocytes. Together, our results suggest that RyR cluster disassembly in failing cardiomyocytes is driven by CaMKII phosphorylation, and promotes impaired cardiomyocyte Ca 2+ homeostasis in this disease.},

Although the Kv7.1/KCNE1 complex has received much attention, the subcellular compartment hosting the assembly is the subject of ongoing debate. Evidence suggests that the complex forms either earlier in the endoplasmic reticulum or directly at the plasma membrane. Kv7.1 and KCNE1 mutations, responsible for long QT syndromes, impair association and traffic, thereby altering IKs currents. We found that Kv7.1 and KCNE1 do not assemble in the first stages of their biogenesis. Data support an unconventional secretory pathway for Kv7.1-KCNE1 that bypasses Golgi. This route targets channels to endoplasmic reticulum–plasma membrane junctions, where Kv7.1-KCNE1 assemble. This mechanism helps to resolve the ongoing controversy about the subcellular compartment hosting the association. Our results also provide new insights into IKs channel localization at endoplasmic reticulum–plasma membrane junctions, highlighting an alternative anterograde trafficking mechanism for oligomeric ion channels.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Calcium plays critical roles in cardiac cells, coupling electrical excitation to mechanical contraction with each heartbeat, while simultaneously mediating biochemical signals that regulate cell growth. While ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are fundamental to generation of elementary calcium release events (sparks) and global calcium elevations that underlie excitation-contraction coupling (ECC), calcium release via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) is also reported in cardiomyocytes. IP3R calcium release modifies ECC as well as contributing to downstream regulation of hypertrophic gene expression. Recent studies suggest that proximal localisation of IP3Rs with RyRs contributes to their ability to modify Ca2+ handling during ECC. Here we aim to determine the mechanism by which IP3Rs modify Ca2+ handling in cardiomyocytes. We develop a mathematical model incorporating the stochastic behaviour of receptor opening that allows for the parametric tuning of the system to reveal the impact of IP3Rs on spark activation. By testing multiple spark initiation mechanisms, we find that Ca2+ release via IP3Rs result in increased propensity for spark initiation within the cardiac dyad. Our simulations suggest that opening of IP3Rs elevates Ca2+ within the dyad, which increase the probability of spark initiation. Finally, we find that while increasing the number of IP3Rs increases the probability of spark formation, it has little effect on spark amplitude, duration, or overall shape. Our study therefore suggests that IP3R play a critical role in modulating Ca2+ signaling for excitation contraction coupling.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

These methods generate lists of single fluorophore positions that capture nanoscale structural details of subcellular organisation, but to develop biological insight, we must post-process and visualize this data in a meaningful way. A large number of algorithms have been developed for localization post-processing, transforming point data into representations which approximate traditional microscopy images, and performing specific quantitative analysis directly on points. Implementations of these algorithms typically stand in isolation, necessitating complex workflows involving multiple different software packages. Here we present PYMEVisualize, an open-source tool for the interactive exploration and analysis of 3D, multicolor, single-molecule localization data. PYMEVisualize brings together a broad range of the most commonly used post-processing, density mapping, and direct quantification tools in an easy-to-use and extensible package.

Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is an optical biophysical technique that non-invasively resolves single molecules through recording the signal intensity at the femtolitre scale. However, recording the behaviour of these biomolecules using in vitro-based assays often fails to recapitulate the full range of variables in vivo that directly confer dynamics. Therefore, there has been an increasing interest in observing the state of these biomolecules within living organisms such as the zebrafish Danio rerio.

	abstract = {The release of Ca2+ by ryanodine receptor (RyR2) channels is critical for cardiac function. However, abnormal RyR2 activity has been linked to the development of arrhythmias, including increased spontaneous Ca2+ release in human atrial fibrillation (AF). Clustering properties of RyR2 have been suggested to alter the activity of the channel, with remodeling of RyR2 clusters identified in pre-clinical models of AF and heart failure. Whether such remodeling occurs in human cardiac disease remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the nanoscale organization of RyR2 clusters in AF patients – the first known study to examine this potential remodeling in diseased human cardiomyocytes. Right atrial appendage from cardiac surgery patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF, or without AF (non-AF) were examined using super-resolution (dSTORM) imaging. Significant atrial dilation and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was observed in persistent AF patients compared to non-AF, with these two parameters significantly correlated. Interestingly, the clustering properties of RyR2 were remarkably unaltered in the AF patients. No significant differences were identified in cluster size (mean {\textasciitilde}18 RyR2 channels), density or channel packing within clusters between patient groups. The spatial organization of clusters throughout the cardiomyocyte was also unchanged across the groups. RyR2 clustering properties did not significantly correlate with patient characteristics. In this first study to examine nanoscale RyR2 organization in human cardiac disease, these findings indicate that RyR2 cluster remodeling is not an underlying mechanism contributing to altered channel function and subsequent arrhythmogenesis in human AF.},

The FPFC performs a cascade of cell processing steps on a microfluidic platform: introduces biological cells one at a time into a solution of a biological reagent that acts as a stimulus, incubates the cells with the stimulus solution in a flow, and sorts the cells into subpopulations according to their phenotypic responses to the provided stimulus. The presented implementation of the FPFC uses intracellular fluorescence as a readout, incubates cells for 75 s, and operates at a throughput of up to 4 cells min−1—resulting in the profiling and sorting of hundreds of cells within a few hours. The design and operation of the FPFC are validated by sorting cells from the human Burkitt's lymphoma cancerous cell line Ramos on the basis of their response to activation of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) by a targeted monoclonal antibody.},

	abstract = {Calcium (Ca2+) plays a central role in mediating both contractile function and hypertrophic signaling in ventricular cardiomyocytes. L-type Ca2+ channels trigger release of Ca2+ from ryanodine receptors for cellular contraction, whereas signaling downstream of G-protein-coupled receptors stimulates Ca2+ release via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), engaging hypertrophic signaling pathways. Modulation of the amplitude, duration, and duty cycle of the cytosolic Ca2+ contraction signal and spatial localization have all been proposed to encode this hypertrophic signal. Given current knowledge of IP3Rs, we develop a model describing the effect of functional interaction (cross talk) between ryanodine receptor and IP3R channels on the Ca2+ transient and examine the sensitivity of the Ca2+ transient shape to properties of IP3R activation. A key result of our study is that IP3R activation increases Ca2+ transient duration for a broad range of IP3R properties, but the effect of IP3R activation on Ca2+ transient amplitude is dependent on IP3 concentration. Furthermore we demonstrate that IP3-mediated Ca2+ release in the cytosol increases the duty cycle of the Ca2+ transient, the fraction of the cycle for which [Ca2+] is elevated, across a broad range of parameter values and IP3 concentrations. When coupled to a model of downstream transcription factor (NFAT) activation, we demonstrate that there is a high correspondence between the Ca2+ transient duty cycle and the proportion of activated NFAT in the nucleus. These findings suggest increased cytosolic Ca2+ duty cycle as a plausible mechanism for IP3-dependent hypertrophic signaling via Ca2+-sensitive transcription factors such as NFAT in ventricular cardiomyocytes.},

	abstract = {The disrupted organisation of the ryanodine receptors (RyR) and junctophilin (JPH) is thought to underpin the transverse tubule (t-tubule) remodelling in a failing heart. Here, we assessed the nanoscale organisation of these two key proteins in the failing human heart. Recently, an advanced feature of the t-tubule remodelling identified large flattened t-tubules called t-sheets, that were several microns wide. Previously, we reported that in the failing heart, the dilated t-tubules up to {\textasciitilde}1 μm wide had increased collagen, and we hypothesised that the t-sheets would also be associated with collagen deposits. Direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), confocal microscopy, and western blotting were used to evaluate the cellular distribution of excitation-contraction structures in the cardiac myocytes from patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) compared to myocytes from the non-failing (NF) human heart. The dSTORM imaging of RyR and JPH found no difference in the colocalisation between IDCM and NF myocytes, but there was a higher colocalisation at the t-tubule and sarcolemma compared to the corbular regions. Western blots revealed no change in the JPH expression but did identify a {\textasciitilde}50\% downregulation of RyR (p = 0.02). The dSTORM imaging revealed a trend for the smaller t-tubular RyR clusters ({\textasciitilde}24\%) and reduced the t-tubular RyR cluster density ({\textasciitilde}35\%) that resulted in a 50\% reduction of t-tubular RyR tetramers in the IDCM myocytes (p {\textless} 0.01). Confocal microscopy identified the t-sheets in all the IDCM hearts examined and found that they are associated with the reticular collagen fibres within the lumen. However, the size and density of the RyR clusters were similar in the myocyte regions associated with t-sheets and t-tubules. T-tubule remodelling is associated with a reduced RyR expression that may contribute to the reduced excitation-contraction coupling in the failing human heart.},

	abstract = {Ryanodine Receptors (RyRs) exhibit dynamic arrangements in cardiomyocytes, and we previously showed that “dispersion” of RyR clusters disrupts Ca2+ homeostasis during heart failure (HF) (Kolstad et al., eLife, 2018). Here, we investigated whether prolonged β-adrenergic stimulation, a hallmark of HF, promotes RyR cluster dispersion, and examined the underlying mechanisms. We observed that treatment of healthy rat cardiomyocytes with isoproterenol for 1 hour triggered progressive fragmentation of RyR clusters. Pharmacological inhibition of CaMKII reversed these effects, while cluster dispersion was reproduced by specific activation of CaMKII, and in mice with constitutively active Ser2814-RyR. A similar role of protein kinase A (PKA) in promoting RyR cluster fragmentation was established by employing PKA activation or inhibition. Progressive cluster dispersion was linked to declining Ca2+ spark fidelity and magnitude, and slowed release kinetics from Ca2+ propagation between more numerous RyR clusters. In healthy cells, this served to dampen the stimulatory actions of β-adrenergic stimulation over the longer term, and protect against pro-arrhythmic Ca2+ waves. However, during HF, RyR dispersion was linked to impaired Ca2+ release. Thus, RyR localization and function are intimately linked via channel phosphorylation by both CaMKII and PKA which, while finely tuned in healthy cardiomyocytes, underlies impaired cardiac function during pathology.
Significance statement The heartbeat is triggered by the release of Ca2+ from Ryanodine Receptors (RyRs) within cardiomyocytes. Recent data indicate RyR arrangement is highly malleable. However, mechanisms controlling RyR reorganisation and the subsequent impact on Ca2+ homeostasis remain unclear. Here, we show that prolonged β-adrenergic stimulation causes RyR clusters to disperse, drastically altering the frequency and kinetics of Ca2+ release events called “Ca2+ sparks” in a process that is dependent on CaMKII and PKA. In healthy cells, these compensatory effects protect against arrhythmogenic Ca2+ over-activity. However, during heart failure, RyR hyper-phosphorylation and dispersion impairs Ca2+ release and cardiac performance. Thus, RyR localization and function are intimately linked via channel phosphorylation which, while finely tuned in health, underlies impaired cardiac function during pathology.},
