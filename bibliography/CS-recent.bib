abstract = {Cell wall appositions (CWAs) are produced reactively by the plant immune system to arrest microbial invasion through the local inversion of plant cell growth. This process requires the controlled invagination of the plasma membrane (PM) in coordination with the export of barrier material to the volume between the plant PM and cell wall. Plant actin dynamics are essential to this response, but it remains unclear how exocytosis and the cytoskeleton are linked in space and time to form functional CWAs. Here, we show that actin-dependent trafficking to immune response sites of Arabidopsis thaliana delivers membrane-integrated FORMIN4, which in turn contributes to local cytoskeletal dynamics. Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy combined with controlled induction of FORMIN4-GFP expression reveals a dynamic population of vesicular bodies that accumulate to form clusters at the PM through an actin-dependent process. Deactivation of FORMIN4 and its close homologs partially compromises subsequent defense and alters filamentous actin (F-actin) distribution at mature CWAs. The localization of FORMIN4 is stable and segregated from the dynamic traffic of the endosomal network. Moreover, the tessellation of FORMIN4 at the PM with meso-domains of PEN3 reveals a fine spatial segregation of destinations for actin-dependent immunity cargo. Together, our data suggest a model where FORMIN4 is a spatial feedback element in a multi-layered, temporally defined sequence of cytoskeletal response. This positional feedback makes a significant contribution to the distribution of actin filaments at the dynamic CWA boundary and to the outcomes of pre-invasion defense.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Among the growing numbers of patients with heart failure, up to one half have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The lack of effective treatments for HFpEF is a substantial and escalating unmet clinical need-and the lack of HFpEF-specific animal models represents a major preclinical barrier in advancing understanding of HFpEF. As established treatments for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) have proven ineffective for HFpEF, the contention that the intrinsic cardiomyocyte phenotype is distinct in these 2 conditions requires consideration. Our goal was to validate and characterize a new rodent model of HFpEF, undertaking longitudinal investigations to delineate the associated cardiac and cardiomyocyte pathophysiology.

METHODS AND RESULTS:The selectively inbred Hypertrophic Heart Rat (HHR) strain exhibits adult cardiac enlargement (without hypertension) and premature death (40% mortality at 50 weeks) compared to its control strain, the normal heart rat. Hypertrophy was characterized in vivo by maintained systolic parameters (ejection fraction at 85%-90% control) with marked diastolic dysfunction (increased E/E'). Surprisingly, HHR cardiomyocytes were hypercontractile, exhibiting high Ca2+ operational levels and markedly increased L-type Ca2+ channel current. In HHR, prominent regions of reparative fibrosis in the left ventricle free wall adjacent to the interventricular septum were observed.

CONCLUSIONS:Thus, the cardiomyocyte remodeling process in the etiology of this HFpEF model contrasts dramatically with the suppressed Ca2+ cycling state that typifies heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. These findings may explain clinical observations, that treatments considered appropriate for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction are of little benefit for HFpEF-and suggest a basis for new therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {Heart failure (HF) is defined by compromised contractile function and is associated with changes in excitation-contraction (EC) coupling and cardiomyocyte organisation. Tissue level changes often include fibrosis, while changes within cardiomyocytes often affect structures critical to EC coupling, including the ryanodine receptor (RyR), the associated protein junctophilin-2 (JPH2) and the transverse tubular system architecture. Using a novel approach, we aimed to directly correlate the influence of structural alterations with force development in ventricular trabeculae from failing human hearts. Trabeculae were excised from explanted human hearts in end-stage failure and immediately subjected to force measurements. Following functional experiments, each trabecula was fixed, sectioned and immuno-stained for structural investigations. Peak stress was highly variable between trabeculae from both within and between failing hearts and was strongly correlated with the cross-sectional area occupied by myocytes (MCSA), rather than total trabecula cross-sectional area. At the cellular level, myocytes exhibited extensive microtubule densification which was linked via JPH2 to time-to-peak stress. Trabeculae fractional MCSA variability was much higher than that in adjacent free wall samples. Together, these findings identify several structural parameters implicated in functional impairment in human HF and highlight the structural variability of ventricular trabeculae which should be considered when interpreting functional data.},

abstract = {Signaling nanodomains rely on spatial organization of proteins to allow controlled intracellular signaling. Examples include calcium release sites of cardiomyocytes where ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are clustered with their molecular partners. Localization microscopy has been crucial to visualizing these nanodomains but has been limited by brightness of markers, restricting the resolution and quantification of individual proteins clustered within. Harnessing the remarkable localization precision of DNA-PAINT (<10 nm), we visualized punctate labeling within these nanodomains, confirmed as single RyRs. RyR positions within sub-plasmalemmal nanodomains revealed how they are organized randomly into irregular clustering patterns leaving significant gaps occupied by accessory or regulatory proteins. RyR-inhibiting protein junctophilin-2 appeared highly concentrated adjacent to RyR channels. Analyzing these molecular maps showed significant variations in the co-clustering stoichiometry between junctophilin-2 and RyR, even between nearby nanodomains. This constitutes an additional level of complexity in RyR arrangement and regulation of calcium signaling, intrinsically built into the nanodomains.},

abstract = {Techniques to analyze human telomeres are imperative in studying the molecular mechanism of aging and related diseases. Two important aspects of telomeres are their length in DNA base pairs (bps) and their biophysical nanometer dimensions. However, there are currently no techniques that can simultaneously measure these quantities in individual cell nuclei. Here, we develop and evaluate a telomere "dual" gold nanoparticle-fluorescent probe simultaneously compatible with both X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and super resolution microscopy. We used silver enhancement to independently visualize the spatial locations of gold nanoparticles inside the nuclei, comparing to a standard QFISH (quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization) probe, and showed good specificity at ∼90%. For sensitivity, we calculated telomere length based on a DNA/gold binding ratio using XRF and compared to quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) measurements. The sensitivity was low (∼10%), probably because of steric interference prohibiting the relatively large 10 nm gold nanoparticles access to DNA space. We then measured the biophysical characteristics of individual telomeres using super resolution microscopy. Telomeres that have an average length of ∼10 kbps, have diameters ranging between ∼60-300 nm. Further, we treated cells with a telomere-shortening drug and showed there was a small but significant difference in telomere diameter in drug-treated vs control cells. We discuss our results in relation to the current debate surrounding telomere compaction.},

abstract = {Transverse (t)-tubules are invaginations of the plasma membrane that form a complex network of ducts, 200-400 nm in diameter depending on the animal species, that penetrates deep within the cardiac myocyte, where they facilitate a fast and synchronous contraction across the entire cell volume. There is now a large body of evidence in animal models and humans demonstrating that pathological distortion of the t-tubule structure has a causative role in the loss of myocyte contractility that underpins many forms of heart failure. Investigations into the molecular mechanisms of pathological t-tubule remodelling to date have focused on proteins residing in the intracellular aspect of t-tubule membrane that form linkages between the membrane and myocyte cytoskeleton. In this review, we shed light on the mechanisms of t-tubule remodelling which are not limited to the intracellular side. Our recent data have demonstrated that collagen is an integral part of the t-tubule network and that it increases within the tubules in heart failure, suggesting that a fibrotic mechanism could drive cardiac junctional remodelling. We examine the evidence that the linkages between the extracellular matrix, t-tubule membrane and cellular cytoskeleton should be considered as a whole when investigating the mechanisms of t-tubule pathology in the failing heart.},

abstract = {The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) plays a fundamental role in transferring information from lower motor neuron to skeletal muscle to generate movement. It is also an experimentally accessible model synapse routinely studied in animal models to explore fundamental aspects of synaptic form and function. Here, we combined morphological techniques, super-resolution imaging, and proteomic profiling to reveal the detailed cellular and molecular architecture of the human NMJ. Human NMJs were significantly smaller, less complex, and more fragmented than mouse NMJs. In contrast to mice, human NMJs were also remarkably stable across the entire adult lifespan, showing no signs of age-related degeneration or remodeling. Super-resolution imaging and proteomic profiling revealed distinctive distribution of active zone proteins and differential expression of core synaptic proteins and molecular pathways at the human NMJ. Taken together, these findings reveal human-specific cellular and molecular features of the NMJ that distinguish them from comparable synapses in other mammalian species.},

abstract = {Aims:In heart failure transverse-tubule (t-tubule) remodelling disrupts calcium release, and contraction. T-tubules in human failing hearts exhibit increased labelling by wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), a lectin that binds to the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex. We hypothesized changes in this complex may explain the increased WGA labelling and contribute to t-tubule remodelling in the failing human heart. In this study we sought to identify the molecules responsible for this increased WGA labelling.

Methods and results:Confocal and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy and proteomic analyses were used to quantify left ventricle samples from healthy donors and patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM). Confocal microscopy demonstrated both WGA and dystrophin were located at t-tubules. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that WGA labelling of t-tubules is largely located within the lumen while dystrophin was restricted to near the sarcolemma. Western blots probed with WGA reveal a 5.7-fold increase in a 140 kDa band in IDCM. Mass spectrometry identified this band as type VI collagen (Col-VI) comprised of $\alpha$1(VI), $\alpha$2(VI), and $\alpha$3(VI) chains. Pertinently, mutations in Col-VI cause muscular dystrophy. Western blotting identified a 2.4-fold increased expression and 3.2-fold increased WGA binding of Col-VI in IDCM. Confocal images showed that Col-VI is located in the t-tubules and that their diameter increased in the IDCM samples. Super-resolution imaging revealed Col-VI was restricted to the t-tubule lumen where increases were associated with displacement in the sarcolemma as identified from dystrophin labelling. Samples were also labelled for type I, III, and IV collagen. Both confocal and super-resolution imaging identified that these collagens were also present within t-tubule lumen.

abstract = {Signalling nanodomains requiring close contact between the plasma membrane and internal compartments, known as 'junctions', are fast communication hubs within excitable cells such as neurones and muscle. Here, we have examined two transgenic murine models probing the role of junctophilin-2, a membrane-tethering protein crucial for the formation and molecular organisation of sub-microscopic junctions in ventricular muscle cells of the heart. Quantitative single-molecule localisation microscopy showed that junctions in animals producing above-normal levels of junctophilin-2 were enlarged, allowing the re-organisation of the primary functional protein within it, the ryanodine receptor (RyR; in this paper, we use RyR to refer to the myocardial isoform RyR2). Although this change was associated with much enlarged RyR clusters that, due to their size, should be more excitable, functionally it caused a mild inhibition in the Ca(2+) signalling output of the junctions (Ca(2+) sparks). Analysis of the single-molecule densities of both RyR and junctophilin-2 revealed an ∼3-fold increase in the junctophilin-2 to RyR ratio. This molecular rearrangement is compatible with direct inhibition of RyR opening by junctophilin-2 to intrinsically stabilise the Ca(2+) signalling properties of the junction and thus the contractile function of the cell.},

Here we detail a method of multi-scale imaging of human cardiac tissue by correlatively combining nano-scale data of direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) with cellular and tissue level data provided by confocal microscopy. By utilising conventional fluorescence dyes the same cellular structures can be imaged with both modalities. Human cardiac tissue was first imaged at the nanoscale to identify macro-molecular membrane complexes containing the cardiac muscle proteins junctophilin (JPH) and the ryanodine receptor (RyR). The distribution of these proteins and an additional cell membrane marker (wheat germ agglutinin, WGA) were subsequently imaged by confocal microscopy. By segmenting dSTORM data into membrane and non-membrane components we demonstrate increased colocalization of RyR with JPH at the plasma-membrane as compared to intracellular compartments. Strategies for antibody labelling, quality control, locating and aligning structures between modalities, and analysis of combined multi-scaled data sets are described.},

abstract = {Evidence from animal models suggest that t-tubule changes may play an important role in the contractile deficit associated with heart failure. However samples are usually taken at random with no regard as to regional variability present in failing hearts which leads to uncertainty in the relationship between contractile performance and possible t-tubule derangement. Regional contraction in human hearts was measured by tagged cine MRI and model fitting. At transplant, failing hearts were biopsy sampled in identified regions and immunocytochemistry was used to label t-tubules and sarcomeric z-lines. Computer image analysis was used to assess 5 different unbiased measures of t-tubule structure/organization. In regions of failing hearts that showed good contractile performance, t-tubule organization was similar to that seen in normal hearts, with worsening structure correlating with the loss of regional contractile performance. Statistical analysis showed that t-tubule direction was most highly correlated with local contractile performance, followed by the amplitude of the sarcomeric peak in the Fourier transform of the t-tubule image. Other area based measures were less well correlated. We conclude that regional contractile performance in failing human hearts is strongly correlated with the local t-tubule organization. Cluster tree analysis with a functional definition of failing contraction strength allowed a pathological definition of 't-tubule disease'. The regional variability in contractile performance and cellular structure is a confounding issue for analysis of samples taken from failing human hearts, although this may be overcome with regional analysis by using tagged cMRI and biopsy mapping.},

abstract = {Confocal laser scanning microscopy and super-resolution microscopy provide high-contrast and high-resolution fluorescent imaging, which has great potential to increase the diagnostic yield of endomyocardial biopsy (EMB). EMB is currently the gold standard for identification of cardiac allograft rejection, myocarditis, and infiltrative and storage diseases. However, standard analysis is dominated by low-contrast bright-field light and electron microscopy (EM); this lack of contrast makes quantification of pathological features difficult. For example, assessment of cardiac allograft rejection relies on subjective grading of H{\&}E histology, which may lead to diagnostic variability between pathologists. This issue could be solved by utilising the high contrast provided by fluorescence methods such as confocal to quantitatively assess the degree of lymphocytic infiltrate. For infiltrative diseases such as amyloidosis, the nanometre resolution provided by EM can be diagnostic in identifying disease-causing fibrils. The recent advent of super-resolution imaging, particularly direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), provides high-contrast imaging at resolution approaching that of EM. Moreover, dSTORM utilises conventional fluorescence dyes allowing for the same structures to be routinely imaged at the cellular scale and then at the nanoscale. The key benefit of these technologies is that the high contrast facilitates quantitative digital analysis and thereby provides a means to robustly assess critical pathological features. Ultimately, this technology has the ability to provide greater accuracy and precision to EMB assessment, which could result in better outcomes for patients.},

abstract = {The contractile properties of cardiac myocytes depend on the calcium (Ca(2+)) released by clusters of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) throughout the myoplasm. Accurate quantification of the spatial distribution of RyRs has previously been challenging due to the comparatively low resolution in optical microscopy. We have combined single-molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM) in a super-resolution modality known as dSTORM with immunofluorescence staining of tissue sections of rat ventricles to resolve a wide, near-exponential size distribution of RyR clusters that lined on average ~57% of the perimeter of each myofibril. The average size of internal couplons is ~63 RyRs (nearly 4 times larger than that of peripheral couplons) and the largest clusters contain many hundreds of RyRs. Similar to previous observations in peripheral couplons, we observe many clusters with one or few receptors; however ≥80% of the total RyRs were detected in clusters containing ≥100 receptors. ~56% of all clusters were within an edge-to-edge distance sufficiently close to co-activate via Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (100nm) and were grouped into 'superclusters'. The co-location of superclusters with the same or adjacent t-tubular connections in dual-colour super-resolution images suggested that member sub-clusters may be exposed to similar local luminal Ca(2+) levels. Dual-colour dSTORM revealed high co-localisation between the cardiac junctional protein junctophilin-2 (JPH2) and RyR clusters that confirmed that the majority of the RyR clusters observed are dyadic. The increased sensitivity of super-resolution images revealed approximately twice as many RyR clusters (2.2clusters/$\mu$m(3)) compared to previous confocal measurements. We show that, in general, the differences of previous confocal estimates are largely attributable to the limited spatial resolution of diffraction-limited imaging. The new data can be used to inform the construction of detailed mechanistic models of cardiac Ca(2+) signalling.},

Cardiac myocytes isolated from tamoxifen-inducible conditional knockdown mice of JPH2 (MCM-shJPH2) were subjected to confocal Ca(2+) imaging. MCM-shJPH2 cardiomyocytes exhibited an increased spark frequency width with altered spark morphology, which caused increased SR Ca(2+) leakage. Single channel studies identified an increased RyR2 open probability in MCM-shJPH2 mice. The increase in spark frequency and width was observed only in MCM-shJPH2 and not found in mice with increased RyR2 open probability with native JPH2 expression. Na(+)/Ca(2+)-exchanger (NCX) activity was reduced by 50% in MCM-shJPH2 with no detectable change in NCX expression. Additionally, 50% inhibition of NCX through Cd(2+) administration alone was sufficient to increase spark width in myocytes obtained from wild-type mice. Additionally, superresolution analysis of RyR2 and NCX colocalization showed a reduced overlap between RyR2 and NCX in MCM-shJPH2 mice. In conclusion, decreased JPH2 expression causes increased SR Ca(2+) leakage by directly increasing open probability of RyR2 and by indirectly reducing junctional NCX activity through increased dyadic cleft Ca(2+). This demonstrates two novel and independent cellular mechanisms by which JPH2 regulates RyR2-mediated SR Ca(2+) leak and heart failure development.},

abstract = {Localization microscopy is a fairly recently introduced super-resolution fluorescence imaging modality capable of achieving nanometre-scale resolution. We have applied the dSTORM variation of this method to image intracellular molecular assemblies in skeletal muscle fibres which are large cells that critically rely on nanoscale signalling domains, the triads. Immunofluorescence staining in fixed adult rat skeletal muscle sections revealed clear differences between fast- and slow-twitch fibres in the molecular organization of ryanodine receptors (RyRs; the primary calcium release channels) within triads. With the improved resolution offered by dSTORM, abutting arrays of RyRs in transverse view of fast fibres were observed in contrast to the fragmented distribution on slow-twitch muscle that were approximately 1.8 times shorter and consisted of approximately 1.6 times fewer receptors. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, we have quantified the nanometre-scale spatial association between triadic proteins using multi-colour super-resolution, an analysis difficult to conduct with electron microscopy. Our findings confirm that junctophilin-1 (JPH1), which tethers the sarcoplasmic reticulum ((SR) intracellular calcium store) to the tubular (t-) system at triads, was present throughout the RyR array, whereas JPH2 was contained within much smaller nanodomains. Similar imaging of the primary SR calcium buffer, calsequestrin (CSQ), detected less overlap of the triad with CSQ in slow-twitch muscle supporting greater spatial heterogeneity in the luminal Ca(2+) buffering when compared with fast twitch muscle. Taken together, these nanoscale differences can explain the fundamentally different physiologies of fast- and slow-twitch muscle.},

abstract = {A major motivation for the use of super-resolution imaging methods in the investigation of cardiac biophysics has been the insight from biophysical considerations and detailed mathematical modeling that the spatial structure and protein organisation at the scale of nanometres can have enormous implications for calcium signalling in cardiac muscle. We illustrate the use of dSTORM based super-resolution in optically thick (∼10 $\mu$m) tissue slices of rat ventricular tissue to visualize proteins at the cardiac Z-disk and compare those images with confocal (diffraction-limited) as well as electron microscopy (EM) data which still provides a benchmark in terms of resolution. $\alpha$-actinin is an abundant protein target that effectively defines the Z-disk in striated muscle and provides a reference structure for other proteins at the Z-line and the transverse tubules. Using super-resolution imaging $\alpha$-actinin labelling provides very detailed outlines of the contractile machinery which we have used to study the properties of Z-disks and the distribution of $\alpha$-actinin itself. We determined the local diameters of the myo-fibrillar and non-myofibrillar space using $\alpha$-actinin labelling. Comparison between confocal and super-resolution based myofibrillar masks suggested that super-resolution data was able to segment myofibrils accurately while confocal approaches were not always able to distinguish neighbouring myofibrillar bundles which resulted in overestimated diameters. The increased resolution of super-resolution methods provides qualitatively new information to improve our understanding of cardiac biophysics. Nevertheless, conventional diffraction-limited imaging still has an important role to play which we illustrate with correlative confocal and super-resolution data.},

abstract = {We conducted super-resolution light microscopy (LM) imaging of the distribution of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and caveolin-3 (CAV3) in mouse ventricular myocytes. Quantitative analysis of data at the surface sarcolemma showed that 4.8% of RyR labeling colocalized with CAV3 whereas 3.5% of CAV3 was in areas with RyR labeling. These values increased to 9.2 and 9.0%, respectively, in the interior of myocytes where CAV3 was widely expressed in the t-system but reduced in regions associated with junctional couplings. Electron microscopic (EM) tomography independently showed only few couplings with caveolae and little evidence for caveolar shapes on the t-system. Unexpectedly, both super-resolution LM and three-dimensional EM data (including serial block-face scanning EM) revealed significant increases in local t-system diameters in many regions associated with junctions. We suggest that this regional specialization helps reduce ionic accumulation and depletion in t-system lumen during excitation-contraction coupling to ensure effective local Ca²⁺ release. Our data demonstrate that super-resolution LM and volume EM techniques complementarily enhance information on subcellular structure at the nanoscale.},

abstract = {The cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR) plays a central role in the control of contractile function of the heart. In cardiac ventricular myocytes RyRs and associated Ca(2+) handling proteins, including membrane Ca(2+) channels, Ca(2+) pumps and other sarcolemmal and sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins interact to set the time course and amplitude of the electrically triggered cytosolic Ca(2+) transient. It has become increasingly clear that protein distribution and clustering on the nanometer scale is critical in determining the interaction of these proteins and the resulting properties of cardiac Ca(2+) handling. Such intricate near-molecular scale detail cannot be visualized with conventional fluorescence microscopy techniques (e.g. confocal microscopy) but it has recently become accessible with optical super-resolution techniques. These techniques retain the advantages of fluorescent marker technology, i.e. high specificity and excellent contrast, but have a spatial resolution approaching 10nm, i.e. objects not much further apart than 10nm can be distinguished, previously only attainable with electron microscopy. We review the use of these novel imaging techniques for the study of protein distribution in cardiac ventricular myocytes and discuss technical considerations as well as recent findings using super-resolution imaging. An emphasis is on single molecule localization based super-resolution approaches and their use to reveal the complexity of RyR cluster morphology, placement and relationship to other excitation-contraction coupling proteins. Super-resolution imaging approaches have already demonstrated their utility for the study of cardiac structure-function relationships and we anticipate that their use will rapidly increase and help improve our understanding of cardiac Ca(2+) regulation.},

abstract = {AIMS:Therapeutic advances in prevention and treatment of myocardial infarction (MI) have decreased patient mortality and increased concern about efficient repair and scar formation, processes that are necessary to attenuate complications such as adverse remodelling and heart failure. Since the rapid accumulation and activity of cardiac fibroblasts is critical for proper scar formation, we hypothesized that infarct fibroblasts are generated by a cardiac-resident progenitor cell population.

METHODS AND RESULTS:We found that infarct fibroblasts in C57BL/6 mice are generated by a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) population that responds robustly to injury by proliferating and accumulating in the infarct. We report that stem cell-derived fibroblasts contribute to the formation of a scar after an infarction by differentiating into matrix-producing fibroblasts closely associated with fibrillar collagen in the infarct. Further characterization of these cells revealed a heterogenous population with expression of both stem cell and canonical cardiac fibroblast markers, suggesting that some have a commitment to the fibroblast phenotype. Our in vitro study of these cells shows that they have extended self-renewal capability and express the primitive marker Nanog. In keeping with these observations, we also report that these cells are multipotent and differentiate readily into fibroblasts as well as other mesenchymal lineages.

CONCLUSION:Cells with the properties of MSCs participate in wound healing after MI in the adult heart.},

abstract = {Intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics provides excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac myocytes. Under pathological conditions, spontaneous Ca(2+) release events can lead to intracellular Ca(2+) travelling waves, which can break, giving transitory or persistent intracellular re-entrant Ca(2+) scroll waves. Intracellular Ca(2+) waves can trigger cellular delayed after-depolarizations of membrane potential, which if they occur in a cluster of a few hundred neighbouring myocytes may lead to cardiac arrhythmia. Quantitative prediction of the initiation and propagation of intracellular Ca(2+) waves requires the dynamics of Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release, and the intracellular spatial distribution of Ca(2+) release units (CRUs). The spatial distribution of ryanodine receptor clusters within a few sarcomeres was reconstructed directly from confocal imaging measurements. It was then embedded into a three-dimensional ventricular cell model, with a resting membrane potential and simple stochastic Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release dynamics. Isotropic global Ca(2+) wave propagation can be produced within the anisotropic intracellular architecture, by isotropic local Ca(2+) diffusion, and the branching Z-disc structure providing inter Z-disc pathways for Ca(2+) propagation. The branching Z-disc provides a broader spatial distribution of ryanodine receptor clusters across Z-discs, which reduces the likelihood of wave initiation by spontaneous Ca(2+) releases. Intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics during catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) was simulated phenomenologically by increasing the Ca(2+) sensitivity factor of the CRU, which results in an increased rate of Ca(2+) release events. Flecainide has been shown to prevent arrhythmias in a murine model of CPVT and in patients. The modelled actions of flecainide on the time course of Ca(2+) release events prevented the initiation of Ca(2+) waves.},

DNA sensors should exhibit fast response to minute concentrations of the target sequence and have the ability to distinguish single-base mismatches from fully complementary target. This study focuses on the response of an electrochemical, CdTe nanoparticle-modified hairpin DNA sensor. The stem-loop structured probes and the blocking poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) molecules were self-assembled on the gold electrode through S-Au bonding, to form a mixed monolayer employed as the sensing platform. Water-soluble CdTe nanoparticles were covalently attached to the hairpin probes (HPPs) and impedance spectroscopy was used for investigation of the electron transfer processes at a modified gold electrode before and after hybridization with the target DNA. The sensor showed reliable and sensitive detection of 4.7 fM of target. Although the selectivity of the sensor towards one-base mismatch targets needs to be improved, discrimination of non-complementary targets was achieved.},

abstract = {Localization microscopy techniques based on localizing single fluorophore molecules now routinely achieve accuracies better than 30 nm. Unlike conventional optical microscopies, localization microscopy experiments do not generate an image but a list of discrete coordinates of estimated fluorophore positions. Data display and analysis therefore generally require visualization methods that translate the position data into conventional images. Here we investigate the properties of several widely used visualization techniques and show that a commonly used algorithm based on rendering Gaussians may lead to a 1.44-fold loss of resolution. Existing methods typically do not explicitly take sampling considerations into account and thus may produce spurious structures. We present two additional visualization algorithms, an adaptive histogram method based on quad-trees and a Delaunay triangulation based visualization of point data that address some of these deficiencies. The new visualization methods are designed to suppress erroneous detail in poorly sampled image areas but avoid loss of resolution in well-sampled regions. A number of criteria for scoring visualization methods are developed as a guide for choosing among visualization methods and are used to qualitatively compare various algorithms.},

abstract = {Using deconvolved confocal microscopy of fluorescently labeled markers for z-disks, t-tubules and ryanodine receptors, we have examined sarcomere organization in cardiac myocytes from rat, rabbit and human. We show that sarcomeres exhibit dislocations in registration and occasionally more complex helicoidal topology. This organization was present at both slack ( approximately 1.8 mum) and long sarcomere lengths ( approximately 2.2 mum). Misregistrations in z-disks persisted over 15-20 sarcomere lengths and appeared to arise primarily from variations in fiber direction; particularly as myofibrils pass around nuclei. In addition, myofibrils twist along the cell length. T-tubules generally follow the sarcomere z-disks although additional elements bridging adjacent myofibrils and along the length of the myofibril are present to varying degrees in all cells. Ryanodine receptors (the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release channel) are generally located within 250 nm of the local plane containing t-tubules and z-disks, but a small fraction ( approximately 2%) is found on longitudinal elements of the t-system between z-disks. The results are discussed with respect to the possible role(s) of such complex z-disk organization and z-disk dislocations in the maintenance of cell structure and sarcomere assembly. In addition, the non-planar organization of z-disks may be important in the propagation of local Ca(2+) waves which may have a useful role in helping maintain the uniformity of sarcomere activation in the presence of t-tubule remodeling.},

abstract = {We have applied an optical super-resolution technique based on single-molecule localization to examine the peripheral distribution of a cardiac signaling protein, the ryanodine receptor (RyR), in rat ventricular myocytes. RyRs form clusters with a mean size of approximately 14 RyRs per cluster, which is almost an order of magnitude smaller than previously estimated. Clusters were typically not circular (as previously assumed) but elongated with an average aspect ratio of 1.9. Edge-to-edge distances between adjacent RyR clusters were often <50 nm, suggesting that peripheral RyR clusters may exhibit strong intercluster signaling. The wide variation of cluster size, which follows a near-exponential distribution, is compatible with a stochastic cluster assembly process. We suggest that calcium sparks may be the result of the concerted activation of several RyR clusters forming a functional "supercluster" whose gating is controlled by both cytosolic and sarcoplasmic reticulum luminal calcium levels.},

abstract = {Confocal and total internal reflection fluorescence imaging was used to examine the distribution of caveolin-3, sodium-calcium exchange (NCX) and ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in rat ventricular myocytes. Transverse and longitudinal optical sectioning shows that NCX is distributed widely along the transverse and longitudinal tubular system (t-system). The NCX labeling consisted of both punctate and distributed components, which partially colocalize with RyRs (27%). Surface membrane labeling showed a similar pattern but the fraction of RyR clusters containing NCX label was decreased and no nonpunctate labeling was observed. Sixteen percent of RyRs were not colocalized with the t-system and 1.6% of RyRs were found on longitudinal elements of the t-system. The surface distribution of RyR labeling was not generally consistent with circular patches of RyRs. This suggests that previous estimates for the number of RyRs in a junction (based on circular close-packed arrays) need to be revised. The observed distribution of caveolin-3 labeling was consistent with its exclusion from RyR clusters. Distance maps for all colocalization pairs were calculated to give the distance between centroids of punctate labeling and edges for distributed components. The possible roles for punctate NCX labeling are discussed.},

abstract = {Quantitative understanding of the Ca(2+) handling in cardiac ventricular myocytes requires accurate knowledge of cardiac ultrastructure and protein distribution. We have therefore developed high-resolution imaging and analysis approaches to measure the three-dimensional distribution of immunolabelled proteins with confocal microscopy. Labelling of single rat cardiac myocytes with an antibody to the Z-line marker alpha-actinin revealed a complex architecture of sarcomere misalignment across single cells. Double immunolabelling was used to relate the Z-line structure to the distribution of ryanodine receptors (RyRs, the intracellular Ca(2+) release channels) and the transverse tubular system. Both RyR and transverse tubular system distributions exhibited frequent dislocations from the simple planar geometry generally assumed in existing mathematical models. To investigate potential effects of these irregularities on Ca(2+) dynamics, we determined the three-dimensional distribution of RyR clusters within an extended section of a single rat ventricular myocyte to construct a model of stochastic Ca(2+) dynamics with a measured Ca(2+) release unit (CRU) distribution. Calculations with this model were compared with a second model in which all CRUs were placed on flat planes. The model with a realistic CRU distribution supported Ca(2+) waves that spread axially along the cell at velocities of approximately 50 mum s(-1). By contrast, in the model with planar CRU distribution the axial wave spread was slowed roughly twofold and wave propagation often nearly faltered. These results demonstrate that spatial features of the CRU distribution on multiple length scales may significantly affect intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics and must be captured in detailed mechanistic models to achieve quantitative as well as qualitative insight.},

abstract = {Detailed knowledge of spatial-temporal behaviours of intracellular calcium dynamics is very important in understanding excitation-contraction coupling of cardiac myocytes under both normal and pathological conditions, such as initiation and propagation of spontaneous calcium waves. A full cell simulation integrating about 10,000 Ca2+ release units (CRUs) in a typical cardiac myocyte is considered a multi-scale, computationally demanding problem. In this paper, we imported an experimentally obtained spatial distribution of Ryanodine Receptor (RyR) clusters into a spatially extended, stochastic model of intracellular Ca2+ dynamics, to investigate the role of the structural bifurcation of Z-disks on the initiation and propagation of intracellular Ca2+ waves from spatially symmetric Ca2+ sparks. Besides, we also proposed a simple parallelization strategy to increase computational speed for this challenging problem in cardiac modelling.},

In this paper, we outline recent progress in our laboratory to develop nanostructured inorganic semiconductors-quantum dots (QDs), and nanostructured organic semiconductors based on polyaniline (PANI), for biosensing applications. Blue luminescent CdTe QDs were prepared directly from an aqueous solution via photo-irradiation and used to demonstrate a simple homogenous DNA sensing platform. Highly luminescent CdTe/CdS core/shell QDs with enhanced photostability were also prepared in an aqueous phase using thioacetamide as a sulphur source. PANI nanostructures have been prepared using a template-free method and the mechanism of their formation is currently being investigated. The effect of having amino acids in the polymerisation solution and using polymeric acids as dopants on the morphology of the nanotubes has been examined. An electrochemical DNA sensor was constructed using PANI nanotubes doped with poly(methyl vinyl ether-alt-maleic acid).},

The morphology of the final polymers was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy techniques. The molecular structure and electrical properties of the products were investigated using a range of spectroscopic methods. The mechanism of nanostructure formation was studied in the light of the chemical nature of the starting monomer and other synthesis conditions, such as the reaction temperature and time and the concentrations of the oxidant and of the dopant molecule. It was established that the mechanism of microsphere formation is based on polymer growth on preformed micelles, which could be seen in freeze-fracture experiments. The presence of p-TSA led to microspheres with a very regular size distribution. The CH3O- group on the aniline side chain also increased the electrocatalytic activity of nanostructured POMA films cast on a glassy carbon electrode for ascorbic acid (AA) oxidation, in comparison with polyaniline nanotubes.},

Impedance spectroscopy was used for investigation of the electron transfer processes at a modified gold electrode before and after hybridization with the target DNA. The sensor showed sensitive and selective detection of the target DNA at the lower temperature, whereas the higher temperature affected the dynamics of the hairpin significantly, reflected in an increased sensitivity of the sensor.},

abstract = {Microscopic calcium (Ca2+) events (such as Ca2+ sparks) are an important area for study, as they help clarify the mechanism(s) underlying intracellular signaling. In the heart, Ca2+ sparks occur as a result of Ca2+ release from the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum, via ryanodine receptor channels. Measurement of Ca2+ spark properties can provide valuable information about the control of ryanodine receptor channel gating in situ, but requires high spatiotemporal resolution imaging, which produces noisy datasets that are problematic for spark detection. Automated detection algorithms may overcome visual detection bias, but missed and false-positive events can distort the distribution of measured Ca2+ spark properties. We present a sensitive and reliable method for the automated detection of Ca2+ sparks in datasets obtained using confocal line-scanning or total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. This matched-filter detection algorithm(MFDA) employs a user-defined object, chosen to mimic Ca2+ spark properties, and the experimental dataset is searched for instances of the object. Detection certainty is provided by nonparametric statistical testing. The supplied codes can also refine the search object on the basis of those detected to further increase detection sensitivity. In comparison to a commonly used, intensity-thresholding algorithm, the MFDA is more sensitive and reliable, particularly at low signal/noise ratios. The MFDA can also be easily adapted to other signal-detection problems in noisy datasets.},

abstract = {Quantum dots (QDs) have unique optical properties and several advantages over conventional organic dyes. The ability to make QDs water soluble allows for use in various biological applications. Smooth metallic surfaces are known to quench the fluorescence of both organic dyes and of certain QDs. This paper provides a comparative study of the quenching ability of an unmodified and a poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG)-modified Au surface, of the emission from an organic dye and from CdSe/ZnS QDs. PEG is a biocompatible molecule widely used for modification of different surfaces when protein resistance is required. Fluorescence measurements show that both an unmodified and a PEG-modified Au surface are able to quench the emission from the dye and the QDs. Some interactions between the QDs and the unmodified An surface were also observed, although the interactions are significantly suppressed by the presence of PEG. The PEG-modified Au surface is suitable for further applications, involving biomolecules, where its efficient quenching ability and protein resistivity can be utilized. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Single rat ventricular myocytes and human ventricle tissue sections were labeled with antibodies against the ryanodine receptor (RyR) and alpha-actinin to examine the 3D distribution of RyRs with confocal microscopy. Image contrast was maximized by refractive index matching and deconvolution. The RyR label formed discrete puncta representing clusters of RyRs or "couplons" around the edges of the myofilaments with a nearest-neighbor spacing of 0.66 +/- 0.06 microm in rat and 0.78 +/- 0.07 microm in human. Each bundle of myofibrils was served by approximately six couplons, which supplied a cross-sectional area of approximately 0.6 microm(2) in rat and approximately 0.8 microm(2) in human. Although the couplons were in reasonable registration with z-lines, there were discontinuities in the longitudinal position of sarcomeres so that dislocations in the order of RyR clusters occurred. There was approximately 53% longitudinal registration of RyR clusters, suggesting a nonrandom placement of couplons around the sarcomere. These data can explain the spherical propagation of Ca(2+) waves and provide quantitative 3D data sets needed for accurate modeling of cardiac Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release. By quantifying labeling intensity in rat ventricular myocytes, a lower limit of 78 RyRs per cluster (on average) was obtained. By modeling the couplon as a disk wrapping around a t-tubule and fitting cluster images, 95% of couplons contained between 120 and 260 RyRs (assuming that RyRs are tight packed with a spacing of 29 nm). Assuming similar labeling efficiency in human, from the fluorescence intensity alone we estimate that human ventricular myocytes contain approximately 30% fewer RyRs per couplon than rat.},

abstract = {Optical fibers can deliver light to, and collect it from, regions deep in tissue. However, reported illumination and fluorescence collection volumes adjacent to the fiber tip have been inconsistent, and systematic data on this topic are not available. Illumination and fluorescence collection profiles were characterized with high spatial resolution for different optical fibers in tissue and various fluids using two-photon flash photolysis and excitation. We confirm that illumination and fluorescence collection volumes for optical fibers are near identical. Collection volume is determined by the core dimensions and numerical aperture (NA) of the fiber and the scattering properties of the medium. For a multimode optical fiber with 100 mum core diam and NA=0.22, 80% of the total fluorescence is collected from a depth of 170 mum in tissue and 465 mum in nonscattering fluid. A semiempirical mathematical description of photon flux adjacent to the fiber tip was also developed and validated. This was used to quantify the extent of temporal blurring associated with propagation of a wavefront of altered fluorescence emission across the region addressed by fiber optic probes. We provide information that will facilitate the design of optical probes for tissue imaging or therapeutic applications.},

abstract = {A new functionalized pyrrole monomer, 3-pyrrolylacrylic acid (PAA) was synthesized. It was used to prepare a copolymer with pyrrole, poly(Py-co-PAA), which was investigated by reflective FT-IR, UV-vis spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. A label-free DNA sensor was prepared based on a poly(Py-co-PAA) film. Hybridization with complementary and non-complementary DNA targets was studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Results show a significant increase in the charge-transfer resistance upon addition of complementary target. The impedance spectra were analyzed by using a modified Randles and Ershler equivalent circuit model. The change in charge-transfer resistance that was used as an index of sensor response was found to be linear with logarithmic target concentration in the range of 2 x 10(-9) to 2 x 10(-7)M. The detection limit was 0.98 nM.},

abstract = {Ca2+ signalling is central to cochlear sensory hair cell physiology through its influence on sound transduction, membrane filter properties and neurotransmission. However, the mechanism for establishing Ca2+ homeostasis in these cells remains unresolved. Canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) Ca2+ entry channels provide an important pathway for maintaining intracellular Ca2+ levels. TRPC3 subunit expression was detected in guinea pig and rat organ of Corti by RT-PCR, and localized to the sensory and neural poles of the inner and outer hair cells (OHCs) by confocal immunofluorescence imaging. A cation entry current with a TRPC-like phenotype was identified in guinea pig and rat OHCs by whole-cell voltage clamp. This slowly activating current was induced by the lowering of cytosolic Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]i) following a period in nominally Ca2+-free solution. Activation was dependent upon the [Ca2+]o and was sustained until [Ca(2+)]i was restored. Ca2+ entry was confirmed by confocal fluorescence imaging, and rapidly recruited secondary charybdotoxin- and apamin-sensitive K(Ca) currents. Dual activation by the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-phospholipase C-diacylglycerol (DAG) second messenger pathway was confirmed using the analogue 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG). Ion substitution experiments showed that the putative TRPC Ca2+ entry current was selective for Na+ > K+ with a ratio of 1: 0.6. The Ca2+ entry current was inhibited by the TRPC channel blocker 2-aminoethyl diphenylborate (2APB) and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, erbstatin analogue. We conclude that TRPC Ca2+ entry channels, most likely incorporating TRPC3 subunits, support cochlear hair cell Ca2+ homeostasis and GPCR signalling.},

abstract = {Membrane-bound NTPDase2 is a member of the ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (E-NTPDase) enzyme family involved in the regulation of P2 receptor signaling. NTPDase2 has broad substrate specificity for extracellular nucleotides, but hydrolyses nucleoside 5'-triphosphates with high preference over nucleoside 5'-diphosphates. In this study, we have sought to determine how enzyme substrates acting on P2 receptors affect intracellular NTPDase2 trafficking. To achieve this, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transiently transfected with rat-specific NTPDase2 cDNA tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP), to allow direct visualisation of subcellular localisation and trafficking of NTPDase2. Cells were superfused with NTPDase2 substrates (ATP and UTP) and synthetic nucleotide analogues (ATPgammaS and ADPbetaS), and confocal image stacks were acquired at regular time intervals. NTPDase2 incorporation into the plasma membrane was determined by comparative analysis of fluorescence intensity in the cytosolic and membrane compartments. GFP-tagged NTPDase2 was fully functional and ATP and ATPgammaS induced membrane incorporation of GFP-NTPDase2 from putative intracellular stores, whilst UTP and ADPbetaS were ineffective. The increased ATP hydrolysis rate correlated with increased NTPDase2 trafficking to the plasma membrane. ATP-induced NTPDase2 trafficking was mediated by activation of endogenous P2X receptors involving Ca2+ entry rather than by P2Y receptor-induced release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Our results suggest that P2X receptor activation stimulates insertion of latent NTPDase2 into the plasma membrane. The increase in surface-located NTPDase2 may reflect a regulatory mechanism counteracting excessive stimulation and desensitisation of P2 receptors.},
