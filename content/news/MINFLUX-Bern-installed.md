Everything arrived in 3 massive crates and after a little bit of sweating we got the breadboard with all optics assembled already on it into the dedicated lab. It sat there in its wrapping for only a very brief period before the very capable and friendly install team (shoutout to Aditya and Sinan) had assembled everything, connecting the impressive electronics/laser/PC stand to the optics unit and microscope stand. We have opted for both 561 nm and 640 nm laser sources, we also have 405 for activation and 488 nm for confocal operation.

This initial assembly was followed by a few days of alignment checks and adjustments to get everything in working order. By the end of the week nice little doughnuts were being produced by the SLMs, the tracking unit was doing its job admirably and our trusty AC had brought down working temps in the lab to 21-22 degrees (depending on chosen settings).

We managed to go through sign-off on Friday morning and everything is nominally humming (subject to further checks in the new week). Now we are looking forward to the start of training by one of the dedicated Abberior MINFLUX application engineers in the coming week. Can't wait!

PS - did we mention that we are creating a new position to support the MINFLUX super-resolution imaging work? We are looking for a **Research Assistant in Super-Resolution Imaging**, with the option to become a permanent position, see our [job openings]({filename}/pages/openings.md) page.
