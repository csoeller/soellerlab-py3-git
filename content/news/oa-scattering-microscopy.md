A new paper with collaborators Jacopo Bertolotti and Sophie Brasselet is just out in Optics Express with the title <a HREF=http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-21199-y>_Wide field fluorescence epi-microscopy behind a scattering medium enabled by speckle correlations_</a>.

We show how one can image through a (discrete) scattering medium with a bog-standard epi-fluorescence microscope and acquire images in a single shot. An improved algorithm allowed us to recover the underlying fluorescent object from the (apparently) featureless speckle pattern that was recorded.

Matthias Hofer, a PhD student of Sophie's came over to Exeter for four months to work on this study with the help of funding that Jacopo had obtained from the EPSRC.

This is a new direction for our lab and working with our colleague Jacopo on this has been a lot of fun. We are still novices but luckily Jacopo is an expert on this topic and we are looking forward to future work in this area.
