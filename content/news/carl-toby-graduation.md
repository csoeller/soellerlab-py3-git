Last Friday we had the December 2019 graduation ceremony which
included the awards ceremony for Carl Harrison and Tobias Lutz who
both completed their PhDs in 2019. It was great to see Carl and Toby
again, this time in fancy attire and stylish hats.


### Pictures from the awards ceremony

Anna (in the middle, between Carl and Toby) used her very fancy DSLR to take excellent photos which I use
here to good effect.

Toby and Carl were in good spirits and it was good to see them doing
well. Carl is doing a postdoc in Sheffield and Toby has started in a
company in Berlin who manufactures optics components for the
semiconductor industry. Toby tells me his is rapidly becoming the
expert for all things microscopy within the sizable company.

This is one of the main rewards of a supervisor, to see your former
students doing well. It was a proud day for the lab. Anna is the next
one to complete while Alex has already more than a year since completing his PhD
under his belt and has been rapidly growing into his postdoctoral role in
the lab.
