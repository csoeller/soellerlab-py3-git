## A new MINFLUX super-resolution microscope is coming to Physiology Bern!

*The top image shows the Abberior Super-resolution microscope that enables fluorescence imaging with truly molcular resolution. The panel below shows proteins that are part of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and exhibits the very high 3D resolution of the MINFLUX microscope.* 

We have been successful in getting a MINFLUX super-resolution microscope for Bern. With generous funding from the [SNSF](https://www.snf.ch) and the Innovationsfond of the University of Bern we have been able to purchase a fairly fully speced system with 561 nm and 647 nm MINFLUX lasers. The system will be delivered and installed in June 2023 and we are looking forward to many exciting applications of single digit nanometer resolution studies in various cell systems, starting with investigations of receptor distributions in cardiac myocytes.

In conjunction with the new microscope we are creating a new position to support the MINFLUX super-resolution imaging work. We are looking for a **Research Assistant in Super-Resolution Imaging**, with the option to become a permanent position, see our [job openings]({filename}/pages/openings.md) page. The deadline is 10 July 2023, apply via the [online advertisement page](https://ohws.prospective.ch/public/v1/jobs/0a167628-1958-4e4d-b402-c95967c87a1f).
