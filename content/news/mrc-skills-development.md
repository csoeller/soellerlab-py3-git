Exeter has just opened applications for three MRC Skills Development Fellowships. MRC Skills Development Fellowships are prestigious personal awards, aimed at early career researchers with a strong background in mathematical, statistical, computational or biophysical modelling and analysis, or for more advanced researchers from a biomedical or clinical background who are seeking to develop strong quantitative skills.

Successful applicants will be housed within the brand new Living Systems Institute where they will be co-located with 7 other MRC Fellowship holders. They will receive 3 years of funding with substantial budgets for travel and consumables as determined by their project needs.
 
Full details of this opportunity are available from [https://www.exetermrcsdf.ac.uk](https://www.exetermrcsdf.ac.uk) and the closing date for the first round of applicants is 11th January 2018.

Christian Soeller is available as a [sponsor for these fellowships](https://www.exetermrcsdf.ac.uk/sponsor-profiles/professor-christian-soeller/). Please [get in touch]({filename}/pages/contact.md) if you would like to discuss your application.
