We have just published our paper on fully quantitative imaging of ryanodine receptors in [_Cell Reports_](http://www.cell.com/cell-reports). A good start to 2018! Using DNA based labeling we were able to push the optical resolution to new limits.

Here are our highlights:

* With enhanced resolution, individual RyRs were observed within dense clusters
*  RyRs appear to assemble randomly and unconstrained
* The ratio of RyR co-clustering with JPH2 varies considerably
between nanodomains
* DNA-based super-resolution enables fully quantitative
imaging at 10 nm resolution
