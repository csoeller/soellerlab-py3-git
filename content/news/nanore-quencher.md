Our paper on using quenchers to simplify multiplexed super-resolution has just appeared online in [_Nano Research_](https://link.springer.com/journal/volumesAndIssues/12274). The investigation was lead by [Tobias Lutz](/pages/people.html).

It is the result of a collaboration with the [Pagliara group](https://projects.exeter.ac.uk/biomicrofluidics) at the [LSI](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/livingsystems/) and [Lorenzo Di Michele](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/directory/dr-lorenzo-di-michele) at the Cavendish.

The method we present in [the paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12274-018-1971-6) simplifies multiplexed DNA-PAINT considerably and has a few fairly simple take home messages:

* Quencher-Exchange-PAINT enables rapid, low-crosstalk Exchange-PAINT imaging __without__ any washing steps
* it enables rapid imager exchange when diffusion is slow (e.g. in tissues)
* in summary, it reduces the complexity of Exchange-PAINT experiments considerably

We also show something what you might call a _negative result_ and which is accordingly not so much emphasized in the paper. So let's make the point clearly here - it is not at all surprising when you think through how the thermodynamics works out but it is nice to show it experimentally:

* the use of competing quenchers is not suitable for increasing the signal-to-background ratio in DNA-PAINT. One cannot do better in terms of the signal-to-background ratio for DNA-PAINT than adjusting imager concentrations to achieve the desired event rate, at least not via simple competitive quencher binding schemes. [^1]

That takes nothing away from the use of quencher strands to effectively and very simply remove imagers from the solution.

[^1]: If you are trying to reduce background arising from imager strands in solution, other strategies have been proposed, e.g. [FRET-PAINT](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28871786).
