Our lab is moving to the Department of Physiology @unibern with effect from 1 October 2021. We are excited to link up with our new colleagues and will also maintain strong connections with @LSI_Exeter which has been a superb place to work over the past few years.

Greatly looking forward to work with students and colleagues @unibern as Prof. of Cardiac Physiology and institute co-director. Really looking forward to fully focus on cardiac muscle physiology again, obviously involving lots of #superresolution #microscopy.
