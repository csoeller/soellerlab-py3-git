### New project to develop super-resolution methods for studying RNA biology

<img width="150" src="{filename}/images/people/evelina.jpg" alt="Evelina Lučinskaitė"/>

In July [Evelina Lučinskaitė]({filename}/pages/people.md) has joined us to study RNA processing in the nucleus with super-resolution microscopy tools.

The project is a collaboration between the [Soeller lab](http://soellerlab.ex.ac.uk/) and the [West lab](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/livingsystems/team/profile/index.php?web_id=Steven_West) at the [Living Systems Institute](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/livingsystems/). We have teamed up with Bristol based industry partner [Bio-Techne](https://www.bio-techne.com/) (to some of you perhaps better known via its [Tocris](https://www.tocris.com/) brand) who will supply us with custom made chemical biology marker tools for new live cell super-resolution methods.

We are very excited that Evelina has started on this exciting project with our project partners. We hope she will have a great experience here with us at the LSI.
