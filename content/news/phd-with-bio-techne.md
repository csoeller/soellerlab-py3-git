We have an exiting PhD opportunity coming up for a September or January start. Applications will open very soon! Please [get in touch]({filename}/pages/contact.md).

### PhD to combine new super-resolution methods with RNA biology

Deadline: open - we are advertising until we fill this position  <br>
Title: **Illuminating mechanisms of RNA transcription by novel optical super-resolution imaging approaches** <br>
Funding: RCUK level Fees & Scholarship, for eligible domestic and EU students <br>
Apply: [Online](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/studying/funding/award/?id=3210)

This new PhD opportunity is a collaboration between the [Soeller lab](http://soellerlab.ex.ac.uk/) and the [West lab](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/livingsystems/team/faculty/west/) at the [Living Systems Institute](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/livingsystems/). We have teamed up with Bristol based industry partner [Bio-Techne](https://www.bio-techne.com/) (to some of you perhaps better known via its [Tocris](https://www.tocris.com/) brand) who will supply us with custom made chemical biology marker tools for new live cell super-resolution methods.

We will apply the new live cell super-resolution imaging modalities to a very topical investigation of RNA biology that is led by Steve West's lab here at the LSI. We have been working with Steve West's group for a few months now and it is a really exciting collaboration with an excellent group.

This is an opportunity for a budding biophysicist, biologist or chemist who is keen to work at the interface of Biophysics and Molecular Biology supported by a strong commercial partner. The project integrates fundamental aspects of Biophysics, Molecular Biology and Biotechnology.

The image below shows some of the data we have already obtained that motivates our project. It was obtained using the very versatile DNA-PAINT super-resolution imaging technology that we have recently enhanced, see also our recent publications on [_quantitative protein imaging_]({filename}/news/ryr-cell-reports.md) and the new modality [_Quencher Exchange-PAINT_]({filename}/news/nanore-quencher.md). In our project we will build on these advances and go the next step to live cell super-resolution imaging.

__Figure__. _The figure shows the distribution of Pol II in the nucleus of a HCT116 cell. The diffraction limited data is shown in green and the super-resolution data obtained using the DNA-PAINT method that is fully established in our laboratories is shown in red-orange. The magnified inset demonstrates the small distances between adjacent Pol II sites which appear to form clusters within some areas of the nucleus. In this project we will extend this methodology from the fixed preparation shown here into live cells and also look simultaneously at Pol II and the exonuclease Xrn2._
