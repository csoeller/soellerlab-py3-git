We recently published a paper that shows relationships between
structure and function of cardiac muscle strips, known in the field as
trabeculae, that to our knowledge were previously not fully appreciated.

The <a HREF=http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-21199-y>paper is open
access</a> in Scientific Reports.

Michelle Munro, lead-author who conducted the study, found that there
was a wide variation in force generated by trabeculae that were excised from
failing human hearts. The variable contractile performance was closely
correlated with the myocyte content that she measured by structural
imaging using immuno-histochemistry and confocal microscopy.

The regions in the muscle strips that did not contain muscle cells
appeared to be largely occupied by extracellular matrix
components. While interesting in itself, our observations suggest that
researchers studying heart function by measuring trabecular force
should investigate trabecula structure before interpreting
their data - something that most labs currently do _not_ do routinely.

This was the last paper hanging over from Michelle's very nice thesis
work - she currently does a postdoc with Pete Jones in Otago, NZ. That
makes it three first author papers from her PhD.

Interestingly, we found it quite difficult to publish these
results. At least partly, we think this is because our
approach is slightly different from what is normally done in the
cardiac contractile mechanics field.

Finally, this is another output from the ongoing collaboration with
fellow Auckland colleagues David Crossman and Marie Ward, as well as clinical
colleague Peter Ruygrok.
