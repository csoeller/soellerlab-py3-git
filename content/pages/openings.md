In modern biophysics it is critical to resolve molecular detail to reveal molecular mechanisms. For this reason new types of high resolution microscopy, often termed super-resolution microscopy, have had a big impact on biophysics. In this project we will pursue a recently proposed alternative way to see near-molecular detail. Classical microscopy generates an enlarged image of a sample. The new modality termed ‘[expansion microscopy](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.8b08742)’ replaces this with a more radical alternative - it physically magnifies, i.e. swells, the sample. This is achieved by attaching a biological sample to a gel matrix which is then expanded by swelling it (the gel material is similar to the gels used in nappies to absorb fluids). This can achieve up to 10-fold expansion in each direction, a remarkable physical magnification that increases effective resolution from ~250 nm to 25 nm using conventional microscopes - a scale that makes macromolecular complexes in biological samples accessible. We will develop these new methods to investigate the structure of microscopic chemical signalling systems, called “nanodomains”, in heart cells which are critical for the forceful contraction of the heart.

__Figure 1__. _With expansion microscopy a heart cell is examined using a fluorescence microscope and reveals microscopic clusters of proteins that act as signalling nano-domains. We achieve fully molecular resolution, so that we can count individual receptors which is key to understanding the biophysics of signalling._


### LSI PhD Studentship Program

**Start**: September 2020<br>
**Apply**: [Online Application via Exeter Website](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/studying/funding/award/?id=3784)

The LSI has opened its first call for its new interdisciplinary PhD programme for the autumn 2020 intake.  We wish to recruit the best and most imaginative students from across the full range of disciplines to join our thriving community of over 60 PhD students.

Students can shape their own projects. [Suggestions for projects](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/livingsystems/research/lsistudentships/projectexamples/) which I supervise or co-supervise include:

*A chemically inducible dimerisation system to monitor and control protein-protein interactions in live cells using super-resolution microscopy* <br>
*Christian Soeller, Steven West and Steffen Scholpp*

*Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and single molecule imaging to trace RNA fate – one molecule at a time* <br>
*Steven West and Christian Soeller*

These two projects are closely linked to an exciting new research project, funded by the BBSRC, between the Soeller and West labs in the LSI.

### BBSRC funded PhD on Protein Cluster Biophysics and Super-Resolution Imaging

**Deadline**: 2nd December 2019 <br>
Title: **Effects of clustering and phosphorylation on nanoscale receptor signalling** <br>
**Funding**: BBSRC, Fees & Scholarship at RCUK levels, for eligible domestic and EU students<br>
**Start**: September 2020<br>
**Apply**: [Online Application via Exeter Website](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/studying/funding/award/?id=3720)

We intend to focus on understanding the basis of the dependence of protein excitability on protein clustering properties. For this we will combine quantitative imaging via super-resolution (Soeller lab) and correlation imaging (Scholpp lab) with new biological insights following the discovery of the role of the protein myospryn for RyR clustering by Prof. Derek Blake's lab in Cardiff .
