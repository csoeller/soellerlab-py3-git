### PhD to work on 3D super-resolution microscopy with deformable mirrors

alt="adaptive optics in astronomy"> In astronomy, adaptive optics
using deformable mirrors has revolutionised ground based observation.
Shown on the left, a telecope is shooting a laser into the sky to
create a [_guide star_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guide_star),
using deformable mirror technology.

In microscopy, we have only recently begun to use deformable mirrors
for flexible and dynamic conntrol of the optical
properties. Deformable mirrors enable us to change the optical
[aberrations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_aberration), either
to compensate for aberrations in the system, or, as we intend here, to
deliberately introduce abberations that allow us to improve the
ability to localise individual molecules in 3D.

alt="mems deformable mirror">
In the project we will use a
[MEMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microelectromechanical_systems)
deformable mirror (see on the right)
to dynamically control the properties of the microscope optics. This
will allow us to build 3D super-resolution images of much improved
quality, which is critical in the imaging of biological samples, such
as animal and plant cells. The resolution improvement as compared to
confocal microscopy is quite dramatic.

Imaging">The project builds on our very successful
[Phase Ramp Technology](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12274-011-0115-z)
which is now used
commercially in all Zeiss Elyra super-resolution microscopes.

The project will provide training in imaging, computing and optical
design. Supervision is provided by

### PhD to work on new tricks that enable imaging in scattering samples

Deadline: **31st January 2018** <br>
Title: **Microscopy in scattering media** <br>
Funding: EPSRC - Fees & Scholarship <br>

<img style="float:left; border-right:18px solid white"
src="{filename}/images/research/imaging-around-corners.png" width="150"
alt="imaging around corners"> The scattering of light in imaging is often
regarded as a problem, but has more recently been recognised to allow
unexpected tricks, for example, seeing around corners, illustrated on
the left. In microscopy, when one images through a scattering medium it seems on first sight that all
detail has been lost in a "fog".  This is illustrated below with an
image taken on our microscope. No clear features are recognisable in the
recorded image, everything appears to be a blur. However, there is
information about the object encoded in the image.

The blurred image is not completely featureless, it contains
information in the form of a
[speckle pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speckle_pattern), a
fine granular pattern of light and dark regions. Such speckle patterns are very familar to those
who have previously worked with _coherent_ light sources, such as
lasers. By clever image processing, the speciality of our collaborator
[Jacopo Bertolotti](http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/staff/jb601), we can recover the image of the actual object, as
if no scattering had taken place. This is illustrated in the
reconstruction that was calculated from the recorded image. It clearly
shows a pattern in the shape of an "F", matching the actual test
pattern that we had used.

<img style="float:right; border-left:10px solid white"
src="{filename}/images/research/image-scattered-reconstruction-text.png" width="300"
alt="scattering imaging"> The PhD project will focus on extending this
method into a practical way to take microscopy images in samples that
are currently regarded as too scattering to allow any meaningful
imaging. Since many biological samples, such as bone or the brain, are
made of such strongly scattering materials, the new methodology has major
relevance for bio-imaging.

The 4-year PhD project is run through the highly regarded
MetaMaterials CDT in Physics, and will be co-supervised by
[Jacopo Bertolotti](http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/staff/jb601)
and
[Christian Soeller](http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/staff/cs463). Please
feel free to contact us, we are happy to discuss all aspects of the
project.
