## Current openings

Since moving to Bern we have a number of new positions to fill to further grow our team.

If you would like to discuss these openings, suggest other project topics, or any other informal discussions please contact Christian Soeller ([christian.soeller@unibe.ch](mailto:christian.soeller@unibe.ch)) in the first instance.


### Research Assistant in Super-Resolution Imaging

**Deadline**: 10 July 2023<br>
**Funding**: position funded for 3 years with option to become permanent, funded by the Institut f√ºr Physiologie<br>
**Start date**: August 2023 or shortly thereafter (by mutual agreement)<br>
**How to Apply**: Apply online via the [online advertisement](https://ohws.prospective.ch/public/v1/jobs/0a167628-1958-4e4d-b402-c95967c87a1f).

Our department is getting a brandnew MINFLUX microscope manufactured by Abberior Instruments. MINFLUX is a new super-resolution fluorescence imaging approach that delivers resolution down to the single nanometer in fluorescently labeled biological samples, thus enabling true molecular resolution imaging. It is unique in providing imaging across six orders of magnitude, from millimetres down to the nanometre, in the same instrument, with precise alignment between multiscale data.

The position presents a somewhat unique opportunity, offered for an initial period of 3 years with the **option to become permanent** upon successful completion of an evaluation after 2.5 years. The focus is to support a new installation of a commercial MINFLUX super-resolution microscope, funded by the University and the SNSF, that will be installed in the Department of Physiology in June 2023.

The position has two aspects, (1) the support of MINFLUX projects across the wider faculty in imaging samples on and providing advice for preparing samples for the MINFLUX microscope and (2) the opportunity to develop your own research portfolio around the application of the very new MINFLUX super-resolution technology, ideally tackling cardiac or neuronal cell biology questions.

Qualifications sought

- PhD in biology, physiology, biophysics or a related discipline
- Experience in confocal and/or super-resolution microscopy
- Ideally some experience with localization based super-resolution microscopy (SMLM)
- Experience in sample preparation for microscopy
- Some experience in image analysis and basic programming skills would be a plus
- Excellent communication, writing and organizational skills

### PhD Fellowship in Super-resolution Imaging of Cardiac Structure and Function

**Deadline**: Applications will be considered from June 2023 <br>
**Funding**: Places are fully funded for 4 years.  This includes payment of tuition fees, a personal stipend for up to 4 years and a training budget.<br>
**Start date**: October 2023 or shortly thereafter (by mutual agreement)<br>
**How to Apply**: Please send applications by email to [Prof. Christian Soeller](mailto:christian.soeller@unibe.ch).

With this PhD project we aim to further develop super-resolution imaging approaches for practical super-resolution imaging of cardiac protein distributions in fixed and live myocytes. A particular focus will be on exploring new machine learning approaches for SMLM analysis. This includes both localisation by machine learning based approaches and analysis of super-resolution data sets for receptor clustering.

Skills/qualifications sought

  - a masters degree in Physiology, Biology, Biomedical Science, Biophysics, Data Science or a closely related field
  - ideally some interest in both computing and also imaging experiments

### Advertisement period
