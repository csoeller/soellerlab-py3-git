### BBSRC funded PhD on Protein Cluster Biophysics and Super-Resolution Imaging

**Deadline**: 2nd December 2019 <br>
Title: **Effects of clustering and phosphorylation on nanoscale receptor signalling** <br>
**Funding**: BBSRC, Fees & Scholarship at RCUK levels, for eligible domestic and EU students<br>
**Start**: September 2020<br>
**Apply**: [Online Application via Exeter Website](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/studying/funding/award/?id=3720)

We intend to focus on understanding the basis of the dependence of protein excitability on protein clustering properties. For this we will combine quantitative imaging via super-resolution (Soeller lab) and correlation imaging (Scholpp lab) with new biological insights following the discovery of the role of the protein myospryn for RyR clustering by Prof. Derek Blake's lab in Cardiff .

Students can shape their own projects. [Suggestions for projects](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/livingsystems/research/lsistudentships/projectexamples/) which I supervise or co-supervise include:

*A chemically inducible dimerisation system to monitor and control protein-protein interactions in live cells using super-resolution microscopy* <br>
*Christian Soeller, Steven West and Steffen Scholpp*

*Quantitative analysis of Wnt pathway components at cytoneme contact sites in the living zebrafish embryo by super-resolution microscopy* <br>
*Steffen Scholpp, Christian Soeller, Kyle Wedgwood*

*Investigating neuromuscular junction collapse in motor neuron disease using patient-derived stem cells, microfluidics and super-resolution microscopy* <br>
*Akshay Bhinge, Christian Soeller, Fabrice Gielen*

*Investigating the self-assembly of microbial cell wall proteins by complementary single molecule sensing, cryo electron microscopy and high-resolution light microscopy* <br>
*Bertram Daum, Frank Vollmer, Christian Soeller*

*Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing and single molecule imaging to trace RNA fate – one molecule at a time* <br>
*Steven West and Christian Soeller*
