We are inviting applications for a fully-funded PhD studentship to commence in January 2019 or as soon as possible thereafter, to be held at the Living Systems Institute at its Streatham Campus.  For eligible students the studentship will cover UK/EU tuition fees plus an annual tax-free stipend.

For this project we have partnered with [Bio-Techne](https://www.bio-techne.com/), a leading developer of high quality reagents and assay systems for biomedical researchers and clinical research laboratories.

## MRC funded PhD on Protein Cluster Biophysics, Stem Cell Repair and Super-Resolution Imaging

**Deadline**: 23rd November 2018 <br>
Title: **Modifying protein clustering as a novel repair strategy in heart failure** <br>
**Funding**: Fees & Scholarship at RCUK levels, for eligible domestic and EU students<br>
**Start**: September 2019<br>
**Apply**: [Online Application via Exeter Website](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/studying/funding/award/?id=3226)

In this project the focus will be on repair strategies for cells in failing hearts. New insight by the participating laboratories suggests that the modulation of protein clustering can boost cellular function and support tissue repair in the heart. We will test the new approaches in stem cell derived models of cardiomyocytes.

## BBSRC funded PhD on Protein Cluster Biophysics and Super-Resolution Imaging

**Deadline**: 3rd December 2018 <br>
Title: **Effects of clustering and phosphorylation on nanoscale receptor signalling** <br>
**Funding**: BBSRC, Fees & Scholarship at RCUK levels, for eligible domestic and EU students<br>
**Start**: September 2019<br>
**Apply**: [Online Application via Exeter Website](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/studying/funding/award/?id=3290)

We intend to focus on understanding the basis of the dependence of protein excitability on the protein clustering properties. For this we will combine quantitative imaging via super-resolution (Soeller lab) and correlation imaging (Scholpp lab) with new biological insights following the discovery of the role of the protein myospryn for RyR clustering.

## EPSRC funded PhD to combine nanometer resolution imaging and single molecule plasmonic sensors

An exiting PhD opening for a September 2019 start. Applications will open very soon! Please [get in touch]({filename}/pages/contact.md).

**Deadline**: **April 2019** <br>
Title: **A DNA-metal nanoparticle metamaterial for improved single-molecule biosensing** <br>
**Funding**: EPSRC Metamaterials CDT, RCUK level Fees & Scholarship, for eligible domestic and EU students <br>
**Apply**: [Online](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/studying/funding/award/?id=3366)

This new PhD opportunity is a collaboration between the [Soeller lab](http://soellerlab.ex.ac.uk/) and the [Vollmer lab](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/livingsystems/team/faculty/vollmer/) at the [Living Systems Institute](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/livingsystems/).
