Increasing  evidence  demonstrates  that  perturbation  of  a  process  in  heart  muscle  called  excitation-contraction coupling leads to cardiac dysfunction. Excitation-contraction coupling is the name given to the process of molecular events that translates the electrical signal, ‘the heartbeat’, that arrives on the cell membrane in the form of the action potential,  into the  release of  intracellularly  stored  calcium  into  the  cytoplasm of  the  heart  cell.  This  process is  vital because calcium activates contraction of heart cells to expel blood from the chambers of the heart and pump it through the circulation. Critical to excitation-contraction coupling are cardiac dyads, membrane microdomains at contact sites between  the  cell  membrane  and  the  sarcoplasmic  reticulum  (a  specialisation  of  the  endoplasmic  reticulum) membrane.

Recently, a molecular study has identified proteins that interact at the dyad and form the “dyad proteome”. Based on this finding we will investigate the dyad proteome in health and protection from disease arising from overexpression of a key dyad protein. We will test the hypothesis that maintaining integrity of protein complexes in the dyad proteome is the basis of protection. In this project a number of new molecular tools as well as novel insights into protein-protein interactions (PPI) in heart cells are coming together to create  qualitatively new understanding. In addition to Ca2+-signalling,   components   of   the   dyad   proteome   are   involved   in   controlling   membrane   curvature,   protein phosphorylation and lipid interactions all of which will be studied by super-resolution microscopy.

Supervisor CS laboratory has recently introduced a new super-resolution imaging method to detect and localise PPI insitu.  Co-supervisor  DB  discovered  and  first  described  a  key  protein-complex  in  the  dyad  proteome,  the  myospryn complex.  Using  the  combined  approaches  in  their  laboratories  we  will  use  the  in-situ  PPI  imaging  approach  to quantitatively  determine  the  changes  in  the  dyad  proteome  in  a  mouse  model  of  heart  failure  and  the  effect  of protection with the support of international collaborator Xander Wehrens (XW). XW has used overexpression of the protein junctophilin-2 (JPH2) to protect against heart failure in a mouse model.    The new approach will map the changes in the dyad proteome for the first time and provide the first comprehensive molecular view of the role of PPIs in maintaining normal cardiac physiology. Successful application of the  multidisciplinary  approaches  to this important  aspect of cardiovascular health has the potential to generate high impact outputs and will form a strong skill base for the candidate’s further career.
