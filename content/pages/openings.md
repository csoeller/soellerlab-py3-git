In this project we will use new super-resolution imaging methods to observe mechanisms of RNA transcription – one of the most fundamental processes in Cell Biology.  Most transcription is carried out by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) but much of what we know about this comes from indirect experiments as we have been historically unable to directly observe the processes taking place.  One of our major research interests is the mechanism by which transcription terminates in a process essential for genome punctuation. Recent work has revealed the fundamental role of so called "protein condensates" that locally concentrate RNA processing proteins in tiny regions within the nucleus. We will study these condensates using the new protein-protein interaction imaging methods that we have recently developed to see how they are formed and regulated in situ. The images on the left, obtained in our laboratories, show these condensates where molecular clusters of Pol II are concentrated. In addition to its fundamental importance, many of the processes and factors implicated in RNA processing are mis-regulated in diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.  This is an exciting opportunity at the interface of Biophysics and Molecular Biology.

The student will receive training in advanced super-resolution miscroscopy, 'big data' analysis, mammalian cell culture, biophysics and RNA biology. 

This studentship is part of the LSI doctoral program. The LSI provides a unique training program by housing world-leading Biologists, Physicists, Mathematicians, Computational Scientists and Engineers using cutting-edge technologies. The LSI's mission is to understand life across all scales - from individual atoms to whole organisms - and to discover approaches for improving health and treating disease. For this program we wish to recruit the best and most imaginative students from across the full range of disciplines to join our thriving community of over 60 PhD students.

### The cardiac dyad signalling proteome and its modulation during cardiac protection

**Deadline**: 7 December 2020 <br>
**BBSRC DTP Studentship** <br>
**Funding**: Fees & Scholarship at RCUK levels, for eligible domestic and EU students<br>
**Start date**: September 2021<br>
**How to Apply**: [Online Application via Exeter Website](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/studying/funding/award/?id=3977)

The project is a collaboration between the [Soeller lab](http://soellerlab.ex.ac.uk/) at the [Living Systems Institute](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/livingsystems/) and the laboratory of [Prof Derek Blake](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/122804-blake-derek) at Cardiff University.

This project focuses on proteins in a structure called "cardiac dyads" which are membrane microdomains at contact sites between  the  cell  membrane  and  the  sarcoplasmic  reticulum  (a  specialisation  of  the  endoplasmic  reticulum) membrane in heart cells. A schematic is shown in the figure on the left. We will use new insights from mass-spectrocopy to identify proteins in the cardiac dyad and use the list of identified proteins ("the dyad proteome") to probe protein-protein interactions within the dyad with new types of imaging that has molecular resolution. This type of imaging, called super-resolution imaging, allows us to directly see and quantify where these proteins are within the dyad and how they interact. For this purpose we are going to use a new imaging method called PD-PAINT which we recently introduced, examples are shown in the figure on the below right, with reference to recent publications in JACS and Science.

The impact of this study arises from the fact that perturbation  of  a  process  in  heart  muscle  called  excitation-contraction coupling leads to cardiac dysfunction. Excitation-contraction coupling is the name given to the process of molecular events that translates the electrical signal, ‘the heartbeat’, that arrives on the cell membrane in the form of the action potential,  into the  release of  intracellularly  stored  calcium  into  the  cytoplasm of  the  heart  cell.  This  process is  vital because calcium activates contraction of heart cells to expel blood from the chambers of the heart and pump it through the circulation.

We will test the hypothesis that maintaining integrity of protein complexes in the dyad proteome is the basis of cardiac protection. In this project a number of new molecular tools as well as novel insights into protein-protein interactions (PPI) in heart cells are coming together to create  qualitatively new understanding. In addition to Ca2+-signalling,   components   of   the   dyad   proteome   are   involved   in   controlling   membrane   curvature,   protein phosphorylation and lipid interactions all of which will be studied by super-resolution microscopy.

The student will be introduced to state-of-the-art mass spectrometry, optical super-resolution imaging and 'big data' processing. Successful application of these multidisciplinary approaches in this project has the potential to generate high impact outputs and will for a form a strong skill base for the candidate’s career.
