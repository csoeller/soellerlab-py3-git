## Current openings

Since moving to Bern we have a number of new positions to fill to further grow our team.

If you would like to discuss these openings, suggest other project topics, or any other informal discussions please contact Christian Soeller ([christian.soeller@unibe.ch](mailto:christian.soeller@unibe.ch)) in the first instance.


### Postdoctoral Fellow in Cardiac Physiology

**Deadline**: Applications will be considered from 30 September 2022<br>
**Funding**: The position is fully funded for 3 years in the first instance with opportunities for extension. Competitive salary levels are offered according to the University of Bern postdocotoral scales.<br>
**Start date**: October 2022 or shortly thereafter (by mutual agreement)<br>
**How to Apply**: Please send applications by email to [Prof. Christian Soeller](mailto:christian.soeller@unibe.ch).

We are looking for a candidate **with experience in physiology, especially muscle physiology, and ideally cardiac physiology** to join us for an exciting project that focuses on dissecting a newly discovered mechanism in cardiac calcium regulation that is termed "Ryanodine receptor dispersion". The basis of this mechanisms seems to be the molecular scale redistribution of ryanodine receptors which leads to altered functional calcium release. This is a novel mechanism for the contractile regulation of cardiac myocytes that we discovered in collaboration with our colleagues from the University of Oslo. Some details on the novel mechanism are described in our recent elife paper [1]. 

The project involves both calcium imaging in ventricular myocytes and super-resolution imaging of fixed and live ventricular myocytes targeting proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling. The project is supported by the Swiss Science Foundation (SNSF) and will involve state-of-the-art imaging using the advanced imaging facilaties in our laboratory. You will join a team of physiologists, biologists and biophysicsts and will have the opportunity to help shape this project according to your skills and ideas.

Skills/qualifications sought

  - a PhD or MD in Physiology, Biology, Biophysics or a closely related field
  - experience with cardiac myocyte physiology (or a closely related field)
  - ideally some experience with fluorescence imaging but this is not essential
  
We will train the successful candidate in super-resolution imaging, confocal imaging and related methods for functional and molecular imaging. Experiments will involve cell isolation of ventricular myocytes from intact hearts, functional calcium imaging of live myocytes [1] and super-resolution imaging of protein distribution and nanoscale signalling structures [2] in these myocytes.

### PhD Fellowship in Super-resolution Imaging of Cardiac Structure and Function

**Deadline**: Applications will be considered from 30 July 2021 <br>
**Funding**: Places are fully funded for 4 years.  This includes payment of tuition fees, a personal stipend for up to 4 years and a training budget.<br>
**Start date**: October 2022 or shortly thereafter (by mutual agreement)<br>
**How to Apply**: Please send applications by email to [Prof. Christian Soeller](mailto:christian.soeller@unibe.ch).

With this PhD project we aim to establish, explore and further develop super-resolution imaging approaches for practical super-resolution imaging of cardiac protein distributions in fixed and live myocytes. A particular focus we want to place on new machine learning approaches for SMLM analysis. This includes both localisation by machine learning based approaches and analysis of super-resolution data sets for receptor clustering.

Skills/qualifications sought

  - a masters degree in Physiology, Biology, Biomedical Science, Biophysics, Data Science or a closely related field
  - ideally some interest in both computing and some level of imaging experimentation

### PhD Fellowship in Computer Modelling of Calcium Signalling in Cardiac Myocytes

**Deadline**: Applications will be considered from 30 July 2021 <br>
**Funding**: Places are fully funded for 4 years.  This includes payment of tuition fees, a personal stipend for up to 4 years and a training budget.<br>
**Start date**: October 2022 or shortly thereafter (by mutual agreement)<br>
**How to Apply**: Please send applications by email to [Prof. Christian Soeller](mailto:christian.soeller@unibe.ch).

In this project we will develop a state-of-the art approach to predict the calcium flows and gating of calcium channels in nanoscopic spaces within cardiac myocytes. We will use novel super-resolution data on cardiac structure and protein distributions to construct spatially realistic models of the nanodomains in which the calcium signalling underlying the contractile function of cardiac myocytes takes place.

Skills/qualifications sought

  - a masters degree in Physiology, Biology, Biomedical Science, Biophysics, Data Science or a closely related quantiative field
  - some interest in scientific computing

### Advertisement period

All positions mentioned above are available immediately and will be advertised until filled. Applications will be considered from September 2022.

## Institute for Physiology

Our laboratory is based at the
[Institute for Physiology](https://physiologie.unibe.ch/) at
the University of Bern. We use advanced imaging technologies to obtain new insights in physiology and calcium signalling.

## City of Bern

The University and Institute are based in the beautiful city of Bern which is the capital of Switzerland. The city itself is worth a visit at any time of the year, particularly handy if you happen to live here. Bern and surrounding areas provide ample opportunity to achieve a good work life balance. This includes biking, skiing, swimming, walking, ice skating and other (non-sport) leisure activities all within short distance from Bern which is very well connected throughout the region by an excellent public transport system.
