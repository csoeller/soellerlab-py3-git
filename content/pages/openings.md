In this project we will use new super-resolution imaging methods to observe mechanisms of RNA
transcription – one of the most fundamental processes in Cell Biology.  Most transcription is carried
out by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) but much of what we know about this comes from indirect experiments as
we have been historically unable to directly observe the processes taking place.  One of our major
research interests is the mechanism by which transcription terminates in a process essential for genome
punctuation. Recent work has revealed the fundamental role of so called "protein condensates" that
locally concentrate RNA processing proteins in tiny regions within the nucleus. We will study these
condensates using the new protein-protein interaction imaging methods that we have recently developed to
see how they are formed and regulated in situ. The images on the left, obtained in our laboratories,
show these condensates where molecular clusters of Pol II are concentrated. In addition to its
fundamental importance, many of the processes and factors implicated in RNA processing are mis-regulated
in diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.  This is an exciting opportunity at the
interface of Biophysics and Molecular Biology.

The student will receive training in advanced super-resolution miscroscopy, 'big data' analysis,
mammalian cell culture, biophysics and RNA biology.

This studentship is part of the LSI doctoral program. The LSI provides a unique training program by
housing world-leading Biologists, Physicists, Mathematicians, Computational Scientists and Engineers
using cutting-edge technologies. The LSI's mission is to understand life across all scales - from
individual atoms to whole organisms - and to discover approaches for improving health and treating
disease. For this program we wish to recruit the best and most imaginative students from across the full
range of disciplines to join our thriving community of over 60 PhD students.

### 3D super-resolution probing of DNA nanostructures using deep learning

**Deadline**: 25 January 2021 <br>
**EPSRC Studentship** <br>
**Funding**: Places are fully funded with
funding also available for overseas applicants.  This includes payment of tuition fees, a personal
stipend for 3.5 years (currently £15,009 per year 2019/20) <br>
**Start date**: September 2021<br>

to Apply**: [Online Application via Exeter Website](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/studying/funding/award/?id=4072)

Recently it has become possible to design and make intricate 3D synthetic nanostructures. This is the
basis of a revolution in material science as well as new drug designs and delivery methods to mention
just a few applications.

In this project we will design and make intricate 3D nanostructures from DNA that we design on the
computer and build in the test tube, so called DNA origami. We will collaborate with DNA nanotechnology
chemists from Imperial College with whom we have a longstanding collaboration to design and synthesise
the DNA origami structures.

A major challenge has been the characterisation of such purpose designed structures to ensure that they
are indeed folded in 3D as designed on the computer. Furthermore, the flexibility and rigidity at the
molecular level is a major focus to give these nanostructures the mechanical properties that make them
useful in applications. To address this challenge we will use new optical imaging techniques, so called
optical super-resolution, that will allow us to directly take molecular scale images of the 3D DNA
origami structures with a resolution that is better than 10 nm. This will also allow us to probe the
flexibility of these structures when we mechanically load them.

An important aspect of the imaging of these nanostructures will be the use of deep learning methods to
analyse the image data and help us construct even higher resolution images of these synthetic
nanostructures. We will implement a number of existing deep learning approaches that have recently been
introduced and train them with our data to provide analysis with previously unattaianble spatial and
temporal resolution.

The insights of the 3D DNA origami design and synthesis will be used to implement and validate molecular
scale biological imaging aplications that, for example, can monitor at the molecular scale how a virus
enters a cell.

The student will receive training in advanced super-resolution miscroscopy, DNA nanotechnology, deep
learning and application of DNA structures for biological imaging.



### New super-resolution imaging techniques to study protein-protein interactions underlying RNA transcriptional control

**Deadline**: 11 January 2021 <br>
**China Scholarship Council (CSC) full-time PhD scholarships hosted at the LSI** <br>

The Living Systems Institute (LSI) offers research projects for full-time PhD scholarships in
collaboration with the China Scholarship Council (CSC). These studentship opportunities are for the
September 2021 intake.

The proposed project would be jointly hosted by the [Soeller lab](http://soellerlab.ex.ac.uk/) and the
[West lab](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/livingsystems/team/profile/index.php?web_id=Steven_West) at the
[Living Systems Institute](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/livingsystems/).

The project builds on new DNA based biological super-resolution imaging tools that we recently
established [1,2,3] and a BBSRC funded project "A new super-resolution proximity assay to probe RNA
transcription condensates".

If you are interested in this or a similar project, please [contact us]({filename}/pages/contact.md)
(email [C.Soeller@exeter.ac.uk](mailto:C.Soeller@exeter.ac.uk)) well in advance of the deadline
(midnight on 11 January 2021).
