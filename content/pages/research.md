### Biophysics of Nanoscale Signalling Systems

We have a long standing interest in local calcium signalling in cardiac muscle. The term _local_ refers to the fact that the critical signalling distances are often in the 10 nm range. Of particular interest is the cardiac ryanodine recptor (RyR) that is typically forming clusters within specialised structures, tight membrane spaces referred to as _junctions_. The RyR is a truly gigantic protein, a homo-tetramer of a 500 kD subunit. A lot of our past work has been focussing on how to monitor the nanoscale arrangement of RyRs and associated proteins in cardiac myocytes.

### Advanced Fluorescence Imaging

We work on several types of advanced fluorescence imaging, including _single molecule localisation microscopy_ (SMLM) and fluorescence microscopy in strongly scattering samples.

#### Quantitative Super-Resolution Imaging

We have been working with super-resolution imaging modalities for a number of years now. Biophysical insight often depends on quantitative knowledge of protein and molecule numbers. Advanced fluorescence imaging now has a number of ways in which [_quantitative imaging_](/pages/quantitative-imaging) can be achieved and we have been pushing the technology to enable this routinely, using [localisation microscopy](/pages/quantitative-imaging), especially [DNA-PAINT](/pages/quantitative-imaging), and [x-ray microscopy](/pages/quantitative-imaging).
