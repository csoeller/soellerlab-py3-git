### Biophysics of Nanoscale Signalling Systems

We have a long standing interest in local calcium signalling in cardiac muscle. The term _local_ refers to the fact that the critical signalling distances are often in the 10 nm range. Of particular interest is the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR) that is typically forming clusters within specialised structures, tight membrane spaces referred to as _junctions_. The RyR is a truly gigantic protein, a homo-tetramer of a 500 kD subunit and approximately 30 nm in size. A lot of our recent work has been concentrating on how to monitor the nanoscale arrangement of RyRs and associated proteins in cardiac myocytes.

### Advanced Fluorescence Imaging

We work on several types of advanced fluorescence imaging, including _single molecule localisation microscopy_ (SMLM), Airy Scan Microscopy (aka Image Scanning Microscopy), and fluorescence microscopy in strongly scattering samples.

#### Quantitative Super-Resolution Imaging

We have been working with super-resolution imaging modalities for a number of years now. Biophysical insight often critically depends on quantitative knowledge of protein and molecule numbers. Advanced fluorescence imaging now has a number of ways in which [_Quantitative Imaging_]({filename}/pages/quantitative_imaging.md) can be achieved and we have been pushing the technology to enable this routinely, using [localisation microscopy]({filename}/pages/quantitative_imaging.md), especially [DNA-PAINT]({filename}/pages/quantitative_imaging.md), and [x-ray microscopy]({filename}/pages/quantitative_imaging.md).

#### Other Advanced Imaging Approaches

We are also pursuing some other aspects of advanced imaging. We are working with [Alex Corbett](http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/staff/ac734) on the use of deformable mirrors, primarily to modulate our microscope point-spread functions. In conjunction with [Jacopo Bertolotti](http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/staff/jb601) we have recently started to investigate new methods to image in deeply scattering samples which is an exciting area of microscopy with a lot of potential. 

### Mathematical Modelling of Nanoscale Calcium Dynamics

Mathematical modelling is critical to make the connection between the protein distributions that we record using our imaging experiments and the functional calcium signalling in intact cells. We have been closely working with our colleagues [Vijay Rajagopal](http://www.bme.unimelb.edu.au/people/staff.php?person_ID=608082), head of the [Cell Structure and Mechanobiology Group](https://cellularsmb.org), and [Edmund Crampin](http://www.ee.unimelb.edu.au/people/staff.php?person_ID=527713), Chair of [Systems Biology](https://systemsbiologylaboratory.org) at the University of Melbourne. A major goal is the automatic model construction from multi-modal 3D imaging data (such as electron microscopy tomography, confocal fluorescence and super-resolution microscopy).
