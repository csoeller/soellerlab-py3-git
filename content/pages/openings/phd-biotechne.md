#### Optical Super-Resolution Imaging and RNA Biology

Optical super-resolution imaging has come to the forefront of biological research because it combines two critical advantages, (1) the specificity and contrast of fluorescence markers which has revolutionized biological imaging and (2) access to the spatial resolution range of 5-200 nm over which bio-molecular interactions occur and that traditional imaging techniques cannot capture. In this project, we will translate methods previously used for optical super-resolution in fixed cells into live cell preparations, supported by the chemical biology expertise of [Bio-Techne](https://www.bio-techne.com/), our partner in an academia-industry collaboration.

In addition to the focus on method development, where we will exploit reversibly binding markers to implement high-resolution live-cell super-resolution imaging, we will use these new approaches to observe mechanisms of RNA transcription – one of the most fundamental processes in Cell Biology.  Most transcription is carried out by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) but much of what we know about this comes from indirect experiments as we have been historically unable to directly observe the processes taking place.  One of our major research interests is the mechanism by which transcription terminates in a process essential for genome punctuation.  In utilizing our existing super-resolution expertise and developing new live cell capability, we aim to perform the first mechanistic dissection of the process by directly imaging it taking place.  In particular, we aim to test the current model that transcriptional termination is caused by a 5’3’ exonuclease, Xrn2, pursuing a transcribing Pol II via the degradation of its associated nascent RNA.  In addition to its fundamental importance, many of the processes and factors implicated in termination are mis-regulated in diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.  This is an exciting opportunity at the interface of Biophysics and Molecular Biology underpinned by a strong commercial partner.

#### An Academia-Industry Collaborative Project

For this project we have partnered with [Bio-Techne](https://www.bio-techne.com/), a leading developer of high quality reagents and assay systems for biomedical researchers and clinical research laboratories. Bio-Techne Bristol is the home of the corporation’s chemical expertise and the manufacturing site for [Tocris](https://www.tocris.com/) brand products. Bio-Techne will provide custom small molecule/peptide tools and fluorescent probes for this project, including development and synthesis of first-in-class compounds, which will enable the candidate to generate optical super-resolution data of outstanding quality. The candidate will have the opportunity to work closely with the industrial collaborator to gain additional commercial experience and transferable skills.

#### Living Systems Institute Hosting Laboratories

The project will be conducted in a collaboration between the Soeller and West laboratories which are based at the recently opened Living Systems Institute at the University of Exeter. The Living Systems Institute is a world-class, next generation, collaborative research community to revolutionise the diagnosis and treatment of diseases through basic research. The Living Systems Institute provides state-of-the-art facilities including optical imaging, molecular biology, mass-spectrometry and high performance computing.

#### Candidate Skills Sought

The ideal candidate has some experience in fluorescence imaging, quantitative analysis and basic biological techniques. The candidate will have a degree in Biophysics, Biology or a related area with a strong quantitative focus. We will provide training for all skills essential to this project including super-resolution imaging, molecular biology, data analysis and scientific writing. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to work in a highly interdisciplinary environment and interact with a highly motivated postgraduate cohort.

__Figure__. _The figure shows the distribution of Pol II in the nucleus of a HCT116 cell. The diffraction limited data is shown in green and the super-resolution data obtained using the DNA-PAINT method that is fully established in our laboratories is shown in red-orange. The magnified inset demonstrates the small distances between adjacent Pol II sites which appear to form clusters within some areas of the nucleus. In this project we will extend this methodology from the fixed preparation shown here into live cells and also look simultaneously at Pol II and the exonuclease Xrn2._
