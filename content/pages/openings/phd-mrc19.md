#### Protein Clustering and Heart Function

Heart failure (HF) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and has reached epidemic proportions in most industrialized nations. Despite major improvements in the treatment and management of the disease, the prognosis for patients with heart failure remains poor, in part due to irreparable damage to cardiac tissue.

Cardiac muscle contraction is enabled by transient increases in cellular calcium levels termed calcium transients. Weakened calcium transients mediated by ryanodine receptors (RyRs), which are intracellular calcium channels, is one of the major pathological features of HF. Recently it has been recognized that heart cell function can be greatly affected by modulation of receptor clustering. Receptor clustering refers to the close grouping of RyRs within intracellular store membranes so that adjacent receptors are only few tens of nanometers apart. In heart cells RyR clustering is essential for physiological contraction.

In pathological conditions, smaller and less dense RyR clusters lead to an increased loss of calcium from intracellular stores and decrease the ability to release calcium, weakening contraction. We hypothesize that cellular function can be restored by enhancing receptor clustering thus facilitating the repair of damaged cardiomyocytes . We will study this by using a novel regulator of RyR clustering that we recently identified, the myospryn family. To investigate this novel repair approach we will use stem cell derived cardiac myocytes (iPSC-CMs). iPSC-CMs provide both a readily manipulatable cellular system and have the potential to provide an alternative to conventional cell transplantation therapies that have shown little clinical benefit to date.

By comparison to other protein modifications, where well-developed biochemical assays are available, we are currently lacking tools to quantitatively study protein clustering, e.g. of RyRs, because such approaches require in situ cellular measurements with molecular resolution. This project will close this gap by refining our recently introduced molecule- counting, fully quantitative super-resolution fluorescence imaging approaches to provide robust and routine in situ molecular clustering assays. We will apply this improved methodology to measure RyR cluster properties and relate this to functional phenotypes, quantified as the ability to release calcium from intracellular stores. Our expectation is that increasing RyR clustering will increase the cellular ability to release calcium, which makes the cell contract strongly, and thus restore function.

This project will firmly establish quantitative and robust protein clustering assays and explore protein clustering as a novel therapeutic target. The new in- situ assays will be applicable to protein targets in a wide variety of cell systems.

#### Hosting Laboratories

The project is a collaboration between the laboratories of Prof Soeller and Dr. Bhinge at the University Exeter and Prof Derek Blake at Cardiff University. The hosting laboratories have pioneered the study of protein clustering with super-resolution imaging, stem cell biology and the biology of the myosprin family of proteins.

#### Candidate Skills Sought

The ideal candidate has some experience in fluorescence imaging, quantitative analysis and basic biological techniques. The candidate will have a degree in Biophysics, Biology or a related area with a strong quantitative focus. We will provide training for all skills essential to this project including super-resolution imaging, cardiac biology, data analysis and scientific writing. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to work in a highly interdisciplinary environment and interact with a highly motivated postgraduate cohort.
