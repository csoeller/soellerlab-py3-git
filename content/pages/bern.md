## City of Bern

The University and Institute are based in the beautiful city of Bern which is the capital of Switzerland. The city itself is worth a visit at any time of the year, particularly handy if you happen to live here. Bern and surrounding areas provide ample opportunity to achieve a good work life balance. This includes biking, skiing, swimming, walking, ice skating and other (non-sport) leisure activities all within short distance from Bern which is very well connected throughout the region by an excellent public transport system.
