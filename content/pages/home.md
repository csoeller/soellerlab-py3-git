Our laboratory is based at the [Living Systems Institute](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/livingsystems/) at the University of Exeter. We use advanced imaging approaches to attack a variety of biophysical questions.

### Biophysics of Nanoscale Signalling Systems

### Advanced Fluorescence Imaging

#### Quantitative Super-Resolution Imaging

#### Imaging in Strongle Scattering Samples

### Mathematical Modelling of Nanoscale Calcium Dynamics
