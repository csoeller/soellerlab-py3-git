## _WE HAVE MOVED_

### The Soeller Lab moved to the University of Bern at the end of 2021

Lab is now based at the
[Institute of Physiology](https://physiologie.unibe.ch/)
at the University of Bern. We will be focusing on cardiac physiology
while also keeping our current focus on super-resolution imaging.

We have a number of positions at all levels to fill (postdoc, PhD,
technician). While separate advertisements will be forthcoming we
encourage anybody who is interested to get in touch proactively.

Please [get in touch](https://physiologie.unibe.ch/~soeller/) for inquiries.

### The Laboratory

Our laboratory **was** based at the [Living Systems Institute](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/livingsystems/) at
the University of Exeter. It is now based at the
[Institute of Physiology](https://physiologie.unibe.ch/)
at the University of Bern.

We use advanced imaging approaches to address a variety of biophysical
questions. Imaging in general, and fluorescence imaging in particular, is playing an increasingly
important role in Biophysics and Biology. Our ability to come up with mechanistic descriptions of
living systems depends to a large extent on our ability to _see_ the components of a cell, an
organism, etc. Our laboratory therefore applies and develops state-of-the-art microscopy methods to
improve our understanding of the world around us.

### Biophysics

Our work is directly motivated by the goal to improve our knowledge of the biophysics and physiology of specific biological systems. Our primary focus is on cardiac muscle biophysics with a unifying theme to elucidate the relationship between nanoscale cell morphology and calcium signalling.

### Advanced Imaging

Our understanding of how biological systems work is  dependent on the ability to see these systems, ideally with a resolution that approaches subcellular and even molecular scales. This has become possible by rapid advances in fluorescence imaging. The holy grail of advanced imaging is fully quantitative microscopy, that allows us to count molecules in situ, fully spatially resolved, so that we can distinguish different populations, provide molecular statistics, and similar quantitative measures that link form and function. Such quantitative molecular imaging is now becoming a practical reality with the latest imaging modalities.
