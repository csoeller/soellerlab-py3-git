### The Laboratory

Our laboratory is based at the [Living Systems Institute](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/livingsystems/) at the University of
Exeter. We use advanced imaging approaches to address a variety of biophysical questions. Imaging in general, and
fluorescence imaging in particular, is playing an increasingly important role in Biophysics and Biology. Our ability
to come up with mechanistic descriptions of living systems depends to a large extent on our ability to _see_ the
components of a cell, an organism, etc. Our laboratory therefore applies and develops state-of-the-art
microscopy methods to improve our understanding of the world around us.

### Biophysics

Our work is directly motivated by the goal to improve our knowledge of the biophysics and physiology of specific biological systems. Our primary focus is on cardiac muscle biophysics with a unifying theme to elucidate the relationship between nanoscale cell morphology and calcium signalling.

### Advanced Imaging

Our understanding of how biological systems work is  dependent on the ability to see these systems, ideally with a resolution that approaches subcellular and even molecular scales. This has become possible by rapid advances in fluorescence imaging. The holy grail of advanced imaging is fully quantitative microscopy, that allows us to count molecules in situ, fully spatially resolved, so that we can distinguish different populations, provide molecular statistics, and similar quantitative measures that link form and function. Such quantitative molecular imaging is now becoming a practical reality with the latest imaging modalities.
