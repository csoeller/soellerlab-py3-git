### The Soeller Lab at the University of Bern

The Soeller
Lab focuses on cardiac physiology
while also having a strong interest in optical super-resolution imaging.

#### Current Openings

Physiology Bern is getting a fully speced **MINFLUX super-resolution system**! We are very excited to introduce truly molecular resolution optical imaging to Bern.

[Research Assistant in Super-Resolution Imaging]({filename}/pages/openings.md) - In conjunction with the new MINFLUX microscope installation we are now looking for a **research assistant** to support the MINFLUX super-resolution imaging work. This is a great opportunity as the post has the option to become permanent after three years. Ideally this is a candidate with experience in super-resolution imaging (SMLM would be great). Please consult our [openings page]({filename}/pages/openings.md) for further details about this position and also see the [online advertisement](https://ohws.prospective.ch/public/v1/jobs/0a167628-1958-4e4d-b402-c95967c87a1f). You can apply via this link until **10 July 2023**.

We encourage anybody who is interested to look at the [position descriptions]({filename}/pages/openings.md). Please [contact us](https://physiologie.unibe.ch/~soeller/) for any inquiries.

### The Laboratory

Our laboratory is based at the
[Institute of Physiology](https://physiologie.unibe.ch/)
at the University of Bern.

We use advanced imaging approaches to address a variety of
questions in cardiac physiology. Imaging in general, and fluorescence imaging in particular, is playing an increasingly
important role in Biophysics and Biology. Our ability to come up with mechanistic descriptions of physiological processes depends to a large extent on our ability to _see_ the components of a cell, an
organism, etc. Our laboratory therefore applies and develops state-of-the-art microscopy methods to
improve our understanding of the world around us.

### Physiology

Our work is motivated by the goal to improve our knowledge of the physiology and biophysics of cardiac calcium regulation. Our primary focus is on cardiac ventricular muscle with a unifying theme to elucidate the relationship between nanoscale cell morphology and calcium signalling.

### Advanced Imaging

Our understanding of how biological systems work is  dependent on the ability to see these systems, ideally with a resolution that approaches subcellular and even molecular scales. This has become possible by rapid advances in fluorescence imaging. The holy grail of advanced imaging is fully quantitative microscopy, that allows us to count molecules in situ, fully spatially resolved, so that we can distinguish different populations, provide molecular statistics, and similar quantitative measures that link form and function. Such quantitative molecular imaging is now becoming a practical reality with the latest imaging modalities.
