#### _Current Opportunities_ - PhD student positions starting in 2018

<img style="float:left; border-right:18px solid white" width="80" src="/images/logos/Achtung.png" alt="Attention"> We have a couple of [exciting openings](/pages/openings) to work with us on state-of-the-art imaging approaches in the
newly opened Living Systems Institute. The new institute provides an exciting interdisciplinary
environment bringing together leaders in Biology, Physics, Medicine and Mathematics. [Check it out](/pages/openings).

### The Laboratory

Our laboratory is based at the [Living Systems Institute](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/livingsystems/) at the University of Exeter. We use advanced imaging approaches to attack a variety of biophysical questions.

### Biophysics

Our work is directly motivated by the goal to improve our knowledge of the biophysics and physiology of specific biological systems. Our primary focus s cardiac muscle with a unifying theme of the relationship between nanoscale cell morphology and contractile function.

### Advanced Imaging

Our understanding of how biological systems work is  dependent on the ability to see these systems, ideally with a resolution that approaches subcellular and molecular scales. This has become possible by rapid advances in fluorescence imaging. The holy grail of advanced imaging is fully quantitative microscopy that is becoming a possibility with the latest imaging modalities.
